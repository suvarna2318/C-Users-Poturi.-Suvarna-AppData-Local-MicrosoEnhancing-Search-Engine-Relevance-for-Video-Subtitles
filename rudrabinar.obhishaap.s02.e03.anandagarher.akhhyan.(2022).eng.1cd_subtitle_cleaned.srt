So you're assuming
that my grandma Mumtaz
2
is Abdul's own daughter
just like Bahadur Uncle?
3
Hmm.
4
Seems like it.
5
Amanat Khan adopted Mumtaz
as his granddaughter.
6
All this time we've known
that my grandma died mysteriously.
7
So my grandpa was responsible
for it?
8
I can't accept it, Alap.
9
You think I can, Shruti?
10
A maestro like him
is actually a murderer?
11
Hey!
12
Something must be wrong.
13
But Amanat Khan's riddle...
14
has shown me a way.
15
What way?
16
"Sarod, sitar, flute, santoor,
shehnai, sarangi, rudrabina.
17
All who possess the discs are 'udara'.
18
'Bibadi' is Mumtaz's daughter".
19
The last line is very significant.
20
It is central
to cracking the mystery.
21
What makes you think so?
22
"Sarod, sitar, flute,
santoor, shehnai, sarangi".
23
Those who received the discs
play the respective instruments.
24
But your mom?
25
She was given the disc
with a rudrabina on it.
26
Why?
27
She never learnt to play the rudrabina.
28
Hmm.
29
And who is "bibadi Mumtaz's daughter"?
30
We don't have time
to think about all this.
31
I think we need to go to Rudrapur
immediately.
32
Naad stole the discs
to find Raga Sanjivani...
33
- Rohini Aunty is in danger and here we're...
- No, Shruti.
34
There's no point going there
before solving this riddle.
35
Mom might get into bigger trouble.
36
Shruti.
37
For the next few days,
don't go anywhere without me.
38
Why?
39
It's clear that Naad was behind the attack
on Ma'am.
40
Hmm.
41
And...
42
it wasn't for Kedar Mishra.
43
It was for Mumtaz.
44
Someone might attack
you and Saaz too.
45
Because both of you
are Madanti's descendants.
46
This is such a fix.
47
We should file a police complaint
against Naad.
48
No point.
49
However...
50
we'll need your mom's help
for something else from the police.
51
For something else?
52
Some... About what?
53
Such files aren't ready at hand.
54
It's a case from 50 years ago.
55
I looked for it urgently
only because you requested me.
56
What are you looking at?
57
There's nothing to see.
58
Nothing abnormal in the case.
59
In your mother Mumtaz's case
60
it was a plain and simple
brain haemorrhage.
61
- Tell me something.
- Yes?
62
Did my mother's corpse have a symbol
like Noorjahan's?
63
I didn't find anything.
Did you?
64
Are you investigating the symbol
we saw this time?
65
I admit...
66
that it looks like the symbol
of the Shiva temple in Rudrapur.
67
But suppose someone commits a murder
68
and puts a stamp
of the Ashok Stambh on the body.
69
Can I arrest the Government of India
for that?
70
What?
71
What is he even...
72
I think he means to say that
the temple is a public place, after all.
73
If someone uses the symbol
for a crime...
74
Exactly.
75
Besides, you are classical musicians.
76
You know how it is.
77
The royal family of Rudrapur
is extremely influential.
78
Politically influential.
79
They are well-respected people.
80
Should we really drag them into this?
81
Do you have anything more to know?
82
No, Ma'am.
83
We will arrest Naad.
84
I've alerted
all the nearby police stations.
85
- Naad is from Rudrapur. Definitely...
- No.
86
He's from Sanatanpur.
87
I've checked his voter ID.
88
We've verified that he's a resident
of that village.
89
Huh!
90
Are we done?
91
- Yes, let's go.
- Hmm.
92
- Thank you.
- See you.

What's the matter with you?
95
Why do you keep coming back
without finishing the job?
96
- Answer me.
- You asked me to kill Noorjahan.
97
I did.
98
You asked me to get the disc.
I did.
99
Please release me now.
100
Why is Noorjahan's daughter Saaz
still alive?
101
Hmm?
102
What has that innocent girl
ever done to you?
103
Why do you want to kill her?
104
Innocent?
105
Innocent, huh?
106
They are lower-caste people
like you.
107
The woman who dared to touch the rudrabina
was their ancestor.
108
Those sinners deserve to die.
109
Instead, they're leading
a respectable life.
110
- And your people are paying for it.
- I don't believe you.
111
What's the problem
with women musicians?
112
I've seen women singing
outside Rudrapur.
113
And publicly.
114
They're not inferior to you.
115
You've deceived us all these years.
116
Going outside the village
has corrupted your mind.
117
You need to cleanse yourself.
118
Do as I say.
119
Go.
120
What happened?
121
Go!
122
CURSE OF THE RUDRABINA
123
CURSE OF THE RUDRABINA
PART 2
124
What happened?
125
Go!
126
Hey.
127
- Don't kick me...
- Hey!
128
Why did you beat my mom like that?
129
Do I owe you an explanation?
Huh?
130
We are human too.
131
We have self respect too.
132
Get that into your head.
133
Such audacity!
134
I don't think we can use Naad anymore.
135
But we've got the disc.
136
Unless we crack the notation...
137
we won't be able to do anything.
138
Can you lose hope right now?
139
No, right?
140
Come here.
141
Okay, forget all this for some time.
142
- Shruti.
- Hmm?
143
They won't harm Mom, right?
144
I just got five months with her.
145
Nothing will happen.
146
Everything will be fine.
147
Please sing a song.
148
I haven't heard you sing in so long.
149
Please sing.
150
Listen to me.
151
You'll feel better.
152
At least, sing for Rohini Aunty.
153
Hmm?
154
If I sing...
155
will Mom be able to hear me?
156
Of course.
She's your mom, after all.
157
Moms can just feel it.
158
Please sing.
159
Time stands still without you
160
Where are you, Mom?
161
While the world sleeps in peace
162
I'm awake all night, Mom
163
You brought me peace
164
But sleep comes no more
165
Time stands still without you
166
Where are you, Mom?
167
Who wakes alone
With the love of a mother?
168
The delusional ties
Keep her awake
169
You're living far away
And all I have is pain
170
You brought me peace
But sleep comes no more
171
When will your pains
Wither away?
172
Your eyes will find
The long-lost happiness
173
When will the pain of our birth
Ebb away?
174
In the everlasting night
The dawn is never to be found
175
Time stands still without you
176
Where are you, Mom?
177
While the world sleeps in peace
178
I am awake all night, Mom
179
You brought me peace
180
But sleep comes no more
181
What happened?
182
Nightmare?
183
Shruti.
184
I've seen that symbol before.
185
Symbol?
186
- Oh...
- On someone else's body.
187
Who?
188
On whose body?
189
Hey!
190
Come fast!
191
- Where?
- Fast!
192
Wait up.
On whose body did you see it?
193
This way.
194
I think this is the lane.
195
Hey, it's Chotu.
196
Hey.
How are you Chotu?
197
Where's Anadi Uncle?
198
What?
199
He ran away!
200
Hey... wait!
201
Chotu!
Hey...
202
Why did you run away...
203
Oh my God!
204
Chotu...
205
When did this happen?
206
See?
207
Nothing can be kept secret forever.
208
I have a lot to know from you.
209
What...
210
- do you want to know?
- History.
211
The history of how Rudrapur
is connected to Anandagarh.
212
I don't know... what you mean.
213
Are you going to risk this child's life?
214
Tell me the truth.
215
We know about Kedar Mishra's connection
to Rudrapur.
216
Now tell me, how are you connected
to Rudrapur?
217
I beg of you...
218
please don't kill my grandson.
219
I'll...
220
I'll tell you everything.
221
Everything.
222
I'm one of you.
223
I'm a Domor too.
224
I used to work
in the Shiva Temple of Rudrapur.
225
It's true.
226
Yes.
227
Back then, the Naad of Rudrapur was...
228
Kedar Mishra.
229
Hmm.
230
You had committed a grave crime.
231
Tell me about it.
232
Come on, speak up!
