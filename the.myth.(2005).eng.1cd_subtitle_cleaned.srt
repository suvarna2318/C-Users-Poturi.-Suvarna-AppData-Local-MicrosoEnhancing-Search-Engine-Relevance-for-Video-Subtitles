1
General, the princess's convoy
has entered our realm.
2
Prepare to receive them.
3
Prepare to receive them!
4
Prepare to receive them!
5
General Meng Yi of Qin
welcomes Your Highness.
6
May it please Her Highness.
7
His Imperial Majesty decrees...
8
that Princess Ok Soo
shall be Concubine Li of Qin,
9
for our nations' mutual
peace and harmony.
10
This is what Princess Ok Soo
was ordered to do.
11
My orders are to bring back
Princess Ok Soo.
12
Whoever interferes shall die!
13
Her Royal Highness
is now Concubine Li of Qin.
14
Whoever dares to go against this order
is an enemy of our state!
15
They leave us no alternative.
16
Prepare to attack.
17
Ready defenses.
18
Ready defenses!
19
Hurry! Protect the Princess!
20
Hurry! Get away from this place!
21
Please come back with me.
22
You are already my betrothed.
23
I cannot go back with you.
24
I cannot abide you
marrying the moribund emperor.
25
It's a surrender
of our sovereignty to Qin!
26
I was forced into this decision.
27
Please understand.
28
You are a general!
How can you taint my honor?
29
Come!
30
My mission is to protect the princess.
31
Draw your sword.
Let's both fulfill
32
our missions.
33
Protect the princess.
34
Save her!
35
Run!
36
Your Highness!
37
28 Feb 2005
38
I have had the same dream
for months now.
39
This time, I'm an ancient general
40
leading a vast army...
41
to rescue...
42
some sort of princess.
43
I fell off a cliff...
44
Hello? William?
45
You're back in Hong Kong?
Great! Come on over!
46
Talk about being at sea!
47
Why are you living on a barge?
48
The research budget
was cut in half last year.
49
With the project unfinished,
I had to sell the flat.
50
So, I moved here with my study.
51
It's not so bad!
Pretty roomy here.
52
So why are you back suddenly?
53
You didn't like the United States?
54
I came to solve your financial problems.
55
I want you to do something for me.
56
<i>Hi, William! This must be Dr. Chan.</i>
57
Just call me Jack.
58
<i>I'm Maggie. Welcome to our
Anti-Gravity Research Project.</i>
59
- Anti-Gravity?
- This is my lab. Check it out.
60
<i>Let's ask Dr. Smith
to give a little demonstration.</i>
61
<i>These are very expensive experiments.</i>
62
<i>Quite impractical,
and unusable on living subjects</i>
63
<i>as no living creature
can survive such speed.</i>
64
I don't understand.
You're a physicist,
65
I'm an archaeologist.
How can I help you?
66
I'm seeking a breakthrough
in the field of mysterious phenomena.
67
Remember that paper you wrote?
68
Over 2,000 years ago,
there was a tiny kingdom south of Dasar
69
whose king became immortal after death.
70
His coffin floated in mid-air.
71
Your paper inspired me.
72
It's just a myth.
73
I can even lend you comic books
about this.
74
Lots of things are called myths
prior to empirical verification.
75
Wireless telephony
was a myth 150 years ago.
76
So was the airplane,
and landing on the moon!
77
Even 50 years ago,
78
computer and digital technology
were a myth.
79
Many people are competing
to develop this technology.
80
If I succeed,
81
I'll change human history.
82
This technology could be vital
to our lives,
83
to surface and air transportation,
even inter-galactic travel!
84
I know you've always wanted
to do something great.
85
No one's ever entered
this ancient tomb before.
86
But my work is archaeology,
and I have my ethic.
87
I do research, not raid tombs.
88
You still can't forget
89
that incident, after all these years?
90
There are things you never forget.
91
We haven't played in ages.
92
How's your game?
93
Jack!
94
Don't you practice anymore?
95
Of course I do, but I just
never shot from this angle before.
96
- So why shoot?
- Because you passed it to me.
97
Don't worry about it.
Come on.
98
That Maggie is your girlfriend?
99
No. She represents my sponsor.
By the way, what happened to Monica?
100
Monica? Forget her.
101
I've been dreaming about a princess.
102
Her name's Ok Soo.
103
I called out her name in my sleep.
104
How do you think Monica took it?
105
Now, back to business.
106
Jack, you've never been
a stickler for rules.
107
You've always trusted your instincts.
108
Instincts helped you
unravel the Dead Sea Scrolls forgery...
109
Jack, hey...
110
Jack!
111
Jack!
112
Do as your instincts tell you.
113
I want to prove it's not a myth,
114
but something real.
115
You're my best friend.
116
I trust you won't let me
face danger alone.
117
Ever tried hitting a golf shot like this?
118
Jack!
119
- What's with you?
- I think I've got heat stroke.
120
Almost there. Come on!
121
Don't lie to me now.
122
You should exercise more regularly.
123
I do! Three hours of golf each day,
124
two hours of tennis...
125
And another dozen hours a day
playing video games.
126
You'll go blind in no time.
127
If you're so fit, why don't you carry me?
128
You can walk. Hurry Up.
129
We won't get in if we're late!
130
Jack, that's the holy man who can fly?
131
Yes. Let's go over there.
132
He really can fly...
133
Get up. Follow me.
134
Hey, up, up.
135
- Hurry.
- Give me a hand.
136
Grab hold of my leg!
137
- You've got strong legs.
- Let go!
138
Wow! Nice stone carvings!
139
You have no idea
how many stories they tell.
140
I didn't come this far
on my last expedition.
141
Jack!
142
The stone coffin's floating here.
143
- Zoom in and see if it's suspended.
- I'm working on it already.
144
Jack,
145
there's a sword beside the coffin.
146
I can see it.
147
I think the inscription
records his deeds.
148
"Mission to Qin"?
149
"This prince once brought treasures
and women to Qin.
150
The Qin Emperor gifted him
one of his concubines,
151
but he picked the emperor's favorite.
152
The emperor reneged
and gave him her painting instead,
153
as well as the Qin Star Gem in apology.
154
The prince even fought against
Qin's greatest warrior,
155
exchanging swords with him."
156
- Hey! Don't!
- What?
157
Jack!
158
- Are you all right?
- What did you just move?
159
I've never seen stones like these.
160
I want some for research.
161
I told you not to steal anything!
162
I was going to return it afterwards.
163
It almost cost me my life!
164
How come the coffin fell
as soon as I pulled it out?
165
His Majesty requested me
166
to paint a portrait of Concubine Li
as a gift to the Prince of Dasar.
167
If she won't smile, how can I paint?
168
I've not seen her smile since she arrived.
169
General Meng!
170
Excellent!
171
That's the smile!
172
Jack!
173
Stop dreaming!
I hear footsteps!
174
- Quick! Lift it up!
- Why don't you ask them to help?
175
Jack!
176
Help me!
177
Come on! Let go!
178
Hey.
179
Who are you?
180
Why come and desecrate our sacred temple?
181
What do you gain by this?
182
I just came in to look for something,
183
I didn't mean to wreck the coffin.
184
It was an accident.
185
Sorry.
186
Are you all right?
187
I was apologizing.
188
How was I to know?
I was trying to help.
189
- Let's go.
- Wait.
190
I told you not to steal.
191
It's for protection.
192
Let's go, Jack!
193
- I took the painting for you as well.
- What?
194
Run.
195
- Jack!
- Wait.
196
Get up. Let's go.
197
Jack!
198
Didn't you say you had backup?
199
All I see are monkeys!
200
You get on board first.
201
Jack!
202
It is too dangerous,
we have to leave now!
203
Come on! Jack!
Fly a bit lower!
204
No! We are hit! Let's go!
205
Jack! Jack!
206
Jack!
207
Thank God!
208
Concubine Li!
209
Concubine Li!
210
Your Highness,
forgive my lapse in your protection.
211
Halt!
Lay down your sword!
212
or I'll kill her!
213
Don't!
214
If only one can live,
I'd rather it be you.
215
Drop it!
216
General!
217
- General Meng Yi!
- Don't help me.
218
I'm beneath your station.
219
Why do you
risk your life for me?
220
A blade is forged
to drink the blood of enemies.
221
I am like a blade,
destined to fight for His Majesty,
222
and die for my country.
223
You are now Concubine Li of Qin.
Protecting you is my duty.
224
Your Highness has suffered a fright.
225
With you beside me,
226
I'm not afraid of anything.
227
We cannot stay here.
We must leave quickly.
228
Meng Yi...
229
General Meng Yi!
230
General, come in.
231
Meng Yi...
232
Meng Yi? General Meng Yi?
233
You promised to protect me.
You can't die!
234
Meng Yi?
235
Meng Yi? Meng Yi...
236
I have nothing
237
left in this world.
238
Not even a relative.
239
Please don't abandon me!
240
I have nothing left but you.
241
Please don't leave me alone!
242
General Meng Yi.
243
Over here, quickly.
244
This is the first time
I've felt so free.
245
No courtly rites and regulations.
246
What a beautiful feeling.
247
This is the first time
I've seen Your Highness smile.
248
- Why don't you look at me?
- Your humble servant does not dare.
249
Don't say such things.
250
Don't take away this feeling.
251
I'll stop calling you general.
252
How's that, Meng Yi?
253
I want to dance.
Shall I dance for you?
254
No, Your Highness. You mustn't.
255
In this world, only the emperor
himself may watch.
256
This is a dance
257
for you alone.
258
Please, Your Highness.
259
We have reached the Great Wall.
260
This is entirely our realm.
261
Our capital, Xianyang
is just over the hill.
262
You are now safe, Concubine Li.
263
I have finally
accomplished my mission.
264
No!
265
I don't want to go to Xianyang.
266
Take me away.
Take me anywhere.
267
I only want to be with you.
268
I don't want to marry the emperor.
269
Why did we struggle to stay alive,
270
just to become slaves to destiny?
271
When will we ever...
272
be free?
273
Not until the day we die?
274
Ok Soo... Concubine Li...
Your Highness, please calm down.
275
Don't forget
276
your own mission.
277
You must live for the sake
of your people.
278
Only with life is there hope.
279
Promise me,
280
you will live!
281
You would have me live
in such agony?
282
Very well.
283
Very well. I promise you.
284
I'll live for you.
285
You! Freeze!
286
I'm levitating!
287
Mid-air coffee.
288
Maggie!
289
Don't!
290
Hello?
291
Jack. Our project has succeeded.
292
Well, almost!
293
What? It's a meteorite?
294
- Outside our solar system?
- <i>That's right.</i>
295
<i>We must now find the rest of them.</i>
296
<i>Where's the painting from the coffin?</i>
297
It's here with me.
298
I'm going to Xian. Meet me there.
299
Bring the painting with you.
300
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Good. See you soon.
301
I'm coming with you.
302
I believe it was forged
some time during the Qin dynasty,
303
This type of scale-like surface material
304
is found only in Qin-dynasty artifacts.
305
Looking at the design and decorations,
306
I'd say it belonged to a Qin general.
307
This is a national treasure.
308
Be careful.
309
Wait. What are you doing?
310
The sword is ours!
311
Jack has bequeathed it to our museum.
312
Our foundation financed this project.
313
Anything found
should belong to the foundation.
314
How can you donate the sword
to the museum?
315
The sword's a grade one national relic.
It belongs to all of humanity.
316
It's only right we return it to a museum
where it can be seeing by everybody.
317
Anyway, what's key to the project
are the meteorites.
318
These two artifacts
have nothing to do with them.
319
Before my experiments
draw a conclusion,
320
anything may prove
to be a critical link.
321
How can you prejudge it
by saying otherwise?
322
My experiments will benefit all mankind.
323
Artifacts are old, dead things.
They have no life, no future!
324
What science is concerned with
is precisely the future!
325
Fine, if that's what you say,
326
then how come these
2,000 year-old artifacts
327
are so important to you?
328
I risked my life for that sword!
329
That was me.
330
Okay! In that case,
when I find the meteorites,
331
- you'll still give them away?
- Yes.
332
As long as it's someone else's artifacts,
I'll return them.
333
No one can plunder relics
from someone else's country
334
and put them in their own museums.
335
They call it "safe-keeping,"
but it's theft.
336
It's despicable behavior.
337
So, what are we going to do now?
338
What can I do?
339
William.
340
Do you want to meet your sponsor
for these last ten years?
341
Of course.
But he doesn't want to see me.
342
I'll bring you to him now.
343
- Right now?
- Come with me.
344
I'll return these relics
to Dasar for you.
345
Thank you.
346
Professor Koo?
347
It's you?
348
It's been years since I was a professor.
349
Mr. Koo, you've been
funding my work
350
all these years?
351
That's right.
352
I had my eye on you
even before you graduated.
353
Maggie, cancel my contract
with the foundation.
354
I won't accept sponsorship
from a tomb-raiding "archaeologist."
355
And you and Jack
weren't raiding tombs in Dasar?
356
I've unearthed many treasures
in my lifetime.
357
But the best ones I found
are you and Jack.
358
- Don't you hate him?
- No.
359
Even if he has hurt me deeply.
360
So what do you want from me?
361
Stay with Jack.
362
Follow him.
363
Enlighten him.
364
He'll make you
the world's greatest scientist.
365
Isn't that your life's dream?
366
"The 36th year of the emperor's reign.
367
A star fell on the eastern province,
and turned to stone on Earth."
368
{\an8}RECORDS OF THE GRAND HISTORIAN
369
{\an8}"The meteorite was engraved..."
370
"...<i>with a curse on the emperor.</i>
371

372

373
Look! General Nangong's returned!
374
Out of the way!
375
Report to the general at once!
376
How is my father?
377
How is His Majesty?
378
Report!
379
General Nangong has returned
with important intelligence.
380
Well,
381
how is His Majesty?
382
His Majesty's...
383
General,
384
the Immortal Pill is ready.
385
On his way back,
General Xu was ambushed by rebels.
386
Prepare the troops for departure.
387
Yes, sir.
388
- Fresh horses!
- Yes sir!
389
If word gets out,
your whole clan will be executed!
390
Your servant wouldn't dare!
391
Please tell the Chancellor
392
I don't know anything.
I'll never tell!
393
I don't know anything.
394
Father had too many
people around him.
395
I fear for our plans.
396
The concubines are ready
to be entombed with him.
397
Your Majesty, the Immortal Pill is ready,
398
but was taken in a rebel ambush.
399
Your servant begs leave
to go retrieve it forthwith!
400
General Meng,
your duty is His Majesty's safety.
401
You should stay.
402
The situation is most urgent!
403
I await His Majesty's orders.
404
His Majesty commands you
to retrieve the pill.
405
- As ordered!
- Wait.
406
His Majesty has few troops
in his entourage.
407
If you go all out for the pill,
408
and the rebels strike,
409
I fear for His Majesty's safety.
410
In that case,
I'll only take the Light Cavalry.
411
I won't tell.
412
His Majesty still needs treatment.
413
Let me try once more.
414
General Meng Yi!
415
Farewell, Your Highness.
416
You must come back.
417
The pill can save His Majesty's life,
418
and therefore yours too.
419
Know that my heart
is yours forever.
420
I await your return.
421
Attention, soldiers of the Meng clan!
422
Those with aged parents are excused!
423
The only sons are excused!
424
Husbands and fathers are excused!
425
Those who are excused, guard the camp!
The rest of you, mount!
426
General!
427
How many years
have we shared our honor?
428
Why can we not
live and die together now?
429
I, Nangong Yan swears to follow you
even unto death!
430
We swear to follow the General!
431
We swear to follow the General!
432
We swear to follow the General!
433
We swear to follow the General!
434
We swear to follow the General!
435
We swear to follow the General!
436
I have orders from the Chancellor
to take the pill.
437
Failure to hand it over
is disobedience, Xu Gui!
438
I can only give the Pill
439
to General Meng.
440
I won't give to anyone else!
441
The Chancellor bears
His Majesty's word.
442
Obey right now!
443
Or die!
444
Prepare to attack!
445
Prepare to attack!

451
Zhao Kuang, His Majesty orders!
Yield at once!
452
You dare fake
an Imperial Decree?
453
General Meng?
454
Leave no one alive!
455
General Zhao!
456
General Meng comes
with an Imperial Decree!
457
Why do you disobey?
458
Your disobedience in the field
will be punished! Attack!
459
Soldiers at the back!
460
No one moves without my orders!
461
Attack!
462
Xu Gui!
463
- General Meng!
- Meng Jie?
464
The Chancellor wants you dead.
465
Behind my troops is the only way out.
466
General, there's no time.
You go with Meng Jie.
467
I'll hold them off.
468
Go!
469
After them!
470
Out of the way!
471
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
472
My bow!
473
Out of the way!
Everyone out of the way!
474
Out of the way!
475
Go! Hurry!
476
Go!
477
Black Wind!
478
Archers, ready!
479
Fire!
480
Fire!
481
General!
482
Take the pill and go!
483
- General!
- The pill must reach the emperor!
484
Protect Concubine Li!
485
Farewell, my General.
486
Go!
487
Black Wind,
488
you have done your duty.
489
Jack.
490
I am sorry. You were right.
491
Those relics should be returned.
492
I made you something.
I hope you like it.
493
I looked up the geographical data
within 500 miles of Xian.
494
You once told me your dreams
of waterfalls and tunnels.
495
I hope this will help.
496
How far is this waterfall
from Mount Li?
497
About 200 kilometers.
498
Sensors indicate a huge cave
behind the waterfall.
499
There were rainstorms one year,
and the cave never reappeared.
500
- Thank you.
- Good-bye.
501
Jack, there's a cave behind the waterfall,
with a huge opening just behind it.
502
That's right.
503
A dozen years ago,
there was a drought.
504
The water dried up.
505
The cave behind the waterfall appeared,
506
and a foolhardy villager climbed in.
507
Then it started to rain,
508
and the water quickly concealed
the entrance again.
509
The villager was never seen again.
510
What do you plan to do?
511
I'm going into the waterfall.
512
- How?
- Get flushed in.
513
You crazy?
514
That's very dangerous!
515
You don't even know
516
if your dream is real.
517
Sure! I don't know
whether it's real or not,
518
or who the person in the dream
is to me.
519
But I can feel her love.
520
So you're saying,
521
unless you unravel this dream,
you'll never be at peace?
522
What a blessed place!
523
Wind, water,
all the elements are in place.
524
Jack, only you
could've brought me here.
525
William, do you copy?
526
Loud and clear, Jack.
527
I can see you.
528
I'll contact you as soon as I'm in.
529
- But if...
- <i>No ifs and buts.</i>
530
I'll be waiting to hear from you.
531
I'll be in touch.
532
Don't worry.
533
Whether it's brain or brawn,
534
he's your superior.
535
<i>Jack, what's happening?</i>
536
<i>Jack!</i>
537
<i>Jack!</i>
538
Are you all right?
539
<i>My ass hurts.</i>
540
William, I see an opening
with man-made designs.
541
<i>Like the sketches you drew?</i>
542
I'll see if I can get inside.
543
I will call you later.
544
Get ready to begin.
545
Now.
546
Meng Yi.
547
Meng Yi.
548
You've finally returned.
549
I am your Ok Soo.
550
You've finally come.
551
Ok Soo...
552
is it really you?
553
You were really waiting for me.
554
Am I dreaming?
555
I promised I'd live for you!
556
I've kept my word.
557
You kept yours too.
558
You've really returned.
559
Jack!
560
Jack, thank you!
561
Without you,
562
this secret would have been buried
for another eternity.
563
This place is exactly
like Jack's dream.
564
I can't explain it scientifically.
565
There are many things in this world
that science can't explain.
566
This cave stays warm the year round.
567
It's shut off from the world,
568
but air flows freely.
569
They made massive constructions
at Mount Li,
570
but dug a 100-mile tunnel
571
to build the mausoleum here.
572
Brilliant!
573
A masterstroke of deception.
574
But where's the entrance
to the mausoleum?
575
<i>Release me

591
Your Highness! Beware!
592
Stop, General Nangong!
593
He's Meng Yi! General Meng!
594
Impossible!
595
He can't be General Meng!
596
No warrior is General Meng's match!
How can he be him?
597
He really is General Meng!
598
There's no mistake!
599
You really are the General.
600
Greetings to the General!
601
Sir, I have followed your order
602
to protect Concubine Li
603
- pending your return.
- Good.
604
Mr. Koo...
605
Great work, Mr. Koo!
606
You've discovered the secret
of levitation.
607
Weightlessness carries serious dangers.
608
If we lose traction
and float off,
609
we'll be adrift forever,
and turn into living fossils.
610
Hold on!
611
After I left you that day,
I returned with the Pill.
612
His Majesty was barely alive,
613
but Zhao Gao doubted the Pill's veracity.
614
He ordered me
to personally test it.
615
Chancellor Li said
it was our honor
616
to test the pill for the emperor,
and forced me to take it too.
617
And so, those
who wanted to live didn't,
618
and those who wished to die
can never do so.
619
General, what happened that day
after I left?
620
That day, after I gave you the Pill...
621
Black Wind,
622
you have done your duty.
623
Fighting...
624
by your side...
625
today...
626
has been my greatest honor in life.
627
I take my leave.
628
Halt!
629
Attack!
630
Attack!
631
Surrender, General!
632
Surrender, General!
633
No!
634
Never!
635
I won't believe it.
636
If General Meng fell in battle...
637
then who are you?
638
I am...
639
Everything is as I expected.
640
Life after death...
641
Troops in an eternal vigil...
642
I've found you at last!
643
Who would have thought
644
the Qin Emperor would use the meteorite
to create a weightless world?
645
General, did you bring troops?
646
No.
647
Wait for me here.
648
Be careful.
649
Who dares to trespass the mausoleum?
650
A Qin-dynasty man?
651
Immortal?
652
Jack!
653
Are you all right?
654
William!
655
You conned me from day one.
656
You've been working for him!
657
- I... I...
- Jack, I told you before.
658
Greed is human nature,
659
and desire for knowledge
drives us.
660
I merely made use of William's greed
and your desire for knowledge.
661
And now my life's work
is complete!
662
When you turned me in,
I told myself...
663
One day, you'll make it up to me.
664
Jack, all I want is to take some stuff
back for experiments.
665
My discoveries will benefit the world.
666
I'll become the greatest scientist
of the century!
667
No one can take anything from here.
668
This is a part of history.
It should stay buried forever!
669
Without you,
670
I couldn't have solved this maze
in several lifetimes!
671
Professor!
672
Scoundrel!
673
How dare you defile the mausoleum?
The penalty is death!
674
Nangong Yan! Careful!
675
Don't shoot.
I want him alive.
676
Take care of Ok Soo.
677
Where's the Immortality Pill?
678
Tell me.
679
Halt!
680
General Nangong!
681
WHEN THE DRAGON PEARL MOVES,
ANNIHILATION ENSUES
682
Pull me in.
Quick, give me a hand.
683
General Nangong!
684
Concubine Li! Run!
685
Run!
686
Give me your hand! Quick!
687
Use your legs.
Right, your legs.
688
Pull me in.
689
A Qin-dynasty deputy imperial general!
690
Tell me!
691
Where's the Immortality Pill?
692
Where's the Qin Emperor's sarcophagus?
693
It must be in the Celestial Palace.
694
Take me there! Take me there!
695
Stay where you are!
696
Don't you dare try
to steal anything
697
or take her away!
698
That depends on
whether you can stop me.
699
Don't worry.
I won't let anyone hurt you.
700
Jack! Help me!
701
Ok Soo, I'll take you
away from here.
702
Let's go.
703
Jack!
704
William!
705
- William!
- Help me!
706
Hang on to me!
707
I only do scientific research.
708
I'm no tomb raider.
709
Jack...
710
you must get out no matter what,
711
and finish my research.
712
Jack.
713
Jack, are we still friends?
714
Jack?
715
You really aren't Meng Yi.
716
No, I'm not.
717
Whether I'm Meng Yi or not
doesn't matter.
718
What matters is that
we leave here now!
719
You're not Meng Yi.
720
I'm not leaving.
721
I'll await Meng Yi's return.
722
Ok Soo, hurry! There's no time!
723
No. He's not dead.
724
I'll wait for him.
725
Ok Soo!
726
Ok Soo!
727
At last! Immortality!
728
General Zhao!
729
General Meng comes
with an Imperial Decree!
730
Why do you disobey?
731
The emperor is dead now,
732
and you have to...
733
From now on,
734
we will never...
735
Oh, no!
736
That last line... the last line!
737
From now on,
738
we will never separate again.
739
You've been lying to me!
740
From beginning to end,
from today onwards...
741
You have been
speaking Cantonese style Mandarin
742
from beginning to end.
