Travel is useful, it exercises the imagination.
All the rest is disappointment and fatigue.
3
Our journey is entirely imaginary.
That is its strength.
4
It goes from life to death. People, animals,
cities, things, all are imagined.
5
It's a novel, just a fictitious narrative.
LittrÃ© says so, and he's never wrong.
6
And besides, in the first place,
anyone can do as much.
7
You just have to close your eyes.
8
It's on the other side of life.

- Louis-Ferdinand CÃ©line,
"Journey to the End of the Night"
10
Fire!
11
You're a real pain in the ass!
12
Hey, one of my Asians just croaked!
13
Enough!
14
They even have cocktails with cherries.
Remember?
15
Hey, jerks!
16
I'll screw you!
17
I'll screw you!
18
Have you seen Ermanno?
19
- I'll screw you! Now!
- Get lost!
20
What the hell?
21
My phone's been stolen!
22
What are your doggies called?
23
I have a pet too... a codfish.
24
Did you call me by my first name?
25
Did you?
26
How dare you!
27
So you're an asshole!
28
I'm starring in two TV dramas...
29
I'm playing a Pope in one,
30
and a junkie on the road to recovery
in the other.
31
Impressive!
32
No theatre work?
33
I'm supposed to do
Shakespeare with Pietro, but...
34
it has to be at least
three hours long,
35
be an ambitious project,
36
and no more small cities!
37
I'm trying to write a piece
for theatre, and the concept is...
38
- What about you?
- I might give up acting.
39
In this shitty country there are never
any good female roles.
40
I'll write my first novel,
a Proust-style piece.
41
Really?
Proust is my favourite writer!
42
Along with Ammaniti...
43
What a coincidence.
44
Who is that woman?
45
Don't you recognise her?
It's Lorena.
46
Who?
47
An ex TV showgirl, now in
full physical and mental decline.
48
Never seen her! But then
I've never had a television.
49
Viola, I know you don't have one.
You tell me all the time.
50
- What does she do now?
- Nothing, of course.
51
Happy birthday, Jep!
52
Happy birthday, Rome!
53
La Colita!
54
<i>To this question, as kids,</i>
55
<i>my friends always gave
the same answer...</i>
56
<i>"pussy."</i>
57
<i>Whereas I answered...</i>
58
<i>"the smell of old people's houses."</i>
59
<i>The question was:</i>
60
<i>"What do you like most, really,
in life?"</i>
61
<i>I was destined for sensibility.</i>
62
<i>I was destined to become a writer.</i>
63
<i>I was destined to become
Jep Gambardella.</i>
64
THE GREAT BEAUTY
65
You paid no attention to me
tonight!
66
Romano, don't start moaning,
we're not an item.
67
- You liked that guy?
- I like everyone and no one.
68
But it's always me you're with
when you like no one.
69
- Will you take me to the airport?
- Sure. What time are you leaving?
70
- In three hours.
- Three hours?
71
Then I should crash on your sofa...
72
Go home, I need to pack
and I don't want anyone around.
73
- But I live miles away.
- See you at 8:00.
74
Goodnight.
75
Guys?
76
Guys?
77
Children!
78
Run along!
79
Catellani?
80
The best, of course.
81
Did Catellani the tailor
make your suit?
82
<i>There was no doubt
about Malagna's shady intentions.</i>
83
<i>The girl should be rescued
at any cost, without loss of time.</i>
84
- Sir, you drank!
- Just enough to forget my birthday.
85
- You want infusion?
- Heavens, no!
86
- I got you a present.
- How sweet!
87
This is a lucky charm from my country.
88
Good thing it's lucky,
because it's pretty ugly.
89
Keep it on your bedside
and stop complaining!
90
I will! And thanks.
91
Wake me up at 15:00, you rascal.
92
You're funny when you call me that!
93
I don't love you!
94
Brilliant!
95
Did you enjoy the performance?
96
Parts of it.
97
That violent head-butt
made me understand many things.
98
- Let's start from the beginning.
- Or the end?
99
You know, Talia Concept
loves to provoke.
100
Don't bother, there are more
important things than provoking me.
101
And this habit of speaking
in the third person is unbearable.
102
What are you reading?
103
I don't need to read, I live on
vibrations, extra-sensory ones.
104
Extrasensoriality aside,
105
what do you mean by vibrations?
106
The poetry of vibrations cannot be
described with the vulgarity of words.
107
Well, try at least.
108
I'm an artist,
I don't need to explain jack shit.
109
So I'll write: "Lives on vibrations,
but doesn't know what they are."
110
Hold on, for fuck's sake,
I never said I don't know what they are.
111
All right, then what is a vibration?
112
I'm starting to dislike this interview,
I sense conflictuality in you.
113
- Conflictuality as a vibration?
- As a pain in the ass.
114
Try to calm down
and tune into my poetic frequency.
115
- You're right.
- Good.
116
Thanks.
117
Let's talk about my mum's
abusive boyfriend.
118
No! I want to know
what a vibration is.
119
It's my radar to intercept the world.
120
Your radar... meaning?
121
You're a pain in the ass, a provoker.
122
A provoker who can't stand a provoker,
that's fascism.
123
I'm a fascist? Fuck off!
124
We got off to a bad start...
125
Talia Concept wants to be interviewed
by your paper, it has many readers.
126
But you're biased.
127
Write about how she has sex
with her fiancÃ© 11 times a day,
128
he's a talented conceptual artist,
129
he covers basketballs with confetti!
He's sensational!
130
Talia Concept is talking about things
that are meaningless to me.
131
All I've heard
is unpublishable fluff.
132
You can't charm me
with things like:
133
"I'm an artist,
I don't need to explain."
134
Our paper has a core
of cultured readers
135
that don't want to be taken for fools.
I work for that core.
136
So let me talk about my eventful,
137
difficult but necessary
journey as an artist!
138
Necessary for who?
139
For heaven's sake, madam,
what is a vibration?
140
- I don't know.
- You don't know.
141
You're an obsessed jerk!
142
I'll tell your editor to send me
a journalist of a higher stature.
143
A piece of advice:
when you speak to my editor,
144
go easy on the stature business.
She's a dwarf, you know.
145
This trait of hers
caused her much suffering.
146
Jep, this interview is a hoot!
147
Maybe, but don't send me to interview
someone who head-butts walls again.
148
- You know what the trick is?
- Foam rubber.
149
Amateur dramatics isn't dead.
150
Did you get offended
about the stature comment?
151
Don't be silly!
That's the funniest bit!
152
I'm a dwarf, it's no secret.
153
It's the first and last thing
everyone says about me.
154
You're a spectacular woman, Dadina.
You've had the career you deserve.
155
But you haven't had the career
you deserve.
156
Maybe I don't have much to say...
157
Bullshit, you're lazy.
You never leave Rome.
158
Why don't you go to Giglio
159
to do that report on the Concordia
I've asked you to do 50 times?
160
Re-heated rice is always tastier
than freshly cooked rice.
161
The old is better than the new.
162
Plans tonight, chÃ©rie?
163
As the great De Blasi,
my predecessor, said:
164
"Tonight I'll do two things,
eat soup and have a shag."
165
Two things that contradict each other.
166
That's what I'd say too,
and she'd reply, in a serious tone:
167
"No, Dadina, they don't,
because they're both hot."
168
You're a hypocrite, Mariella!
169
You hurt me.
170
And everyone knows.
171
You're a hypocrite!
172
You hurt me!
173
And everyone knows
the only virtue is hypocrisy.
174
Like that.
175
Good.
176
Great.
177
There's a publishing house
in Ancona, it's not that small,
178
they want an interview book about you.
179
Another interview book?
We're obsessed with interviews!
180
Can't you hear them?
"As I always say"... to who?
181
Forget it!
182
And honestly,
who'll buy a book called:
183
"Visions and revisions.
Jep Gambardella's Galaxy"?
184
It's a serious title!
185
Unfortunately in this country,
in order to be taken seriously,
186
you have to take yourself seriously.
187
I only wrote one novel, 40 years ago.
Impossible to find too...
188
Bullshit, "The Human Apparatus"
was a masterpiece!
189
It even won the... what was it?
190
- The Bancarella prize.
- Shit, the Bancarella prize!
191
You're very kind, but forget it...
it'd be too pompous.
192
I can't, you'll put me
in an awkward position.
193
I've agreed and I've even accepted
an advance...
194
- How much?
- 1,500 euros.
195
Give it back, I'll give you 1,500 euros.
196
By the way,
I spoke to the theatre people.
197
They'll give you three nights
but you pay for the lights.
198
Who cares about that!
199
Jep, this is great news.
200
It's really great news.
Thank you!
201
What's wrong?
I was talking...
202
Are you still up?
203
It's time to go to bed.
204
That's Viola Bartoli, Bartoli's widow.
205
The guy who was killed,
the actual Bartoli.
206
Viola has a 50 metre yacht
that belonged to Himmler, the Nazi.
207
You know what I call Viola?
208
- No, what?
- "Too-good-to-poo".
209
- I don't understand.
- Because she's pernickety.
210
Usually pernickety people don't poo.
211
When I introduced Trumeau
to my family, my father said:
212
"Miss, before marrying my son,
have you ever seen him poo?"
213
- How gross!
- It's not as bad as you think.
214
Actually, my wife and I are the only
couple in Italy who are in love.
215
Orietta, watch out for Lello.
216
Yes, I know.
217
He's the world's greatest salesman,
he cons everyone.
218
In no time he'll get you to spend
every cent on whatever he's selling.
219
You always flatter me.
220
Just because I express myself well
doesn't mean I'm always working!
221
- What do you do?
- I sell toys.
222
Not just in a shop,
223
he's a wholesaler on a global scale,
he even sells to the Chinese!
224
What about him?
225
Don't you know him? Sebastiano Paf,
perhaps Italy's greatest poet.
226
He wrote: "Upwards and onwards
with life, down with reminiscence."
227
He's on the Dukan Diet,
so Dadina won't leave him.
228
- Is he with her?
- He is, but she...
229
Like at high school.
230
Why doesn't he ever talk?
231
Because he listens.
232
- Stop sniffing up with your nose?
- Bugger off.
233
Jep's found a theatre for me.
234
- Ronconi will feel threatened...
- Come on, that joke's old.
235
Do you want the lead role?
236
I'm no longer an actress,
I'm a writer now.
237
Maybe...
238
Maybe I'll make a film.
239
We were talking...
240
- Viola, darling!
- Help me, I'm worried about my son.
241
- What can I do?
- Why don't you talk to him?
242
You always say you're good
with strangers...
243
That's the problem, I'm too good.
244
- Is he seeing a therapist?
- Yes, but he wants to stop going.
245
Take him to a psychiatrist, they're
pragmatic: Ativan, Prozac and so on.
246
That stuff makes him feel worse.
247
Relax, he's always been odd,
he is what he is.
248
By the way, have you tried
AhÃ¨'s endive quiche?
249
It's the first time she's made it
and it's better than my mum's,
250
please, you must try some!
251
You changed your hair colour.
252
I feel Pirandello-esque recently...
253
- Great jazz, no?
- Not really.
254
The Ethiopian jazz scene is the only
interesting one today.
255
I'm from Milan, to be honest...
I find Romans...
256
unbearable!
257
The best people in Rome
are the tourists.
258
Take Italy...
259
What are we famous for overseas?
Fashion and pizza.
260
A country of designers and cooks!
261
How can someone who sells toys,
bringing joy to the world,
262
be such a pessimist and a defeatist?
You're dark.
263
- Dark?
- Yes.
264
I heard Gisella Montanelli
went to loans sharks
265
to pay her hairdressing debts.
266
Jep says I'm dark!
267
Gisella's really sunk that low?
268
Rome is the only city in the world
where Marxism has truly existed.
269
You can't excel over others
for more than a week,
270
you're immediately brought back
to mediocrity.
271
Rome is pure collectivism.
272
Pure collectivism.
Stefania, what utter nonsense!
273
Do you know that Flaubert wanted to
write a book about Nothing?
274
If he'd met you, we'd have had
a great book, what a shame!
275
You're a misogynist.
276
It's not all about you, I'm not
a misogynist, I'm a misanthropist.
277
When hate's involved,
one must aim high.
278
You're a dark man.
279
I'm a transparent person,
without a doubt!
280
I don't understand...
281
Lello!
282
Aren't you stopping tonight?
283
Mum!
When I see you I blush!
284
Andrea...
285
- You're crazy.
- No, Mum, I'm not crazy!
286
I've got problems.
287
"As the light flashed,
love sat down in the corner."
288
"Shy and distracted as it was."
289
"This is why
we could tolerate life no longer."
290
Gosh,
no one's quoted me for years!
291
I read your book as a teenager,
I've never forgotten the end.
292
Stop right there, you're stroking
my ego in a dangerous way.
293
You must've been deeply in love
when you wrote it.
294
Moravia made the same comment,
more or less.
295
Even though he worded it
a bit better.
296
I once saw Piazza Navona
covered in snow.
297
Really? What was it like?
298
White!
299
When I come to Rome I live there.
300
Deep in the outskirts...
301
What job do you do?
302
Me? I'm rich.
303
Great job.
304
You didn't enjoy it.
305
I know I'm not very good.
306
Why do you say that?
307
Plus it's so sad being good,
you risk becoming deft.
308
It didn't seem like you cared much.
309
You're very beautiful, Orietta,
very, very beautiful.
310
I take photos, you know.
Of myself.
311
At all times of the day,
to get to know myself.
312
- With the self-timer, with my phone...
- Interesting.
313
My Facebook friends say
I take great photos.
314
I bet there are some of you naked...
315
- A few.
- I knew it!
316
Do you want to see them?
317
- Of course.
- I'll get my computer.
318
<i>The most important thing I discovered
a few days after turning 65</i>
319
<i>is that I can't waste any more time
doing things I don't want to do.</i>
320
<i>When I arrived in Rome,</i>
321
<i>at the age of 26,</i>
322
<i>I took a plunge, rather quickly,</i>
323
<i>almost without realising it,</i>
324

325
<i>But I didn't just want

326
Sacconi should be in charge.
327
Antonini's a fucking pain in the ass!
328
<i>I wanted to be
the king of the high life.</i>
329
<i>And I succeeded.</i>
330
<i>I didn't just want

331

332
- Gambardella?
- That's me.
333
Sorry for showing up like this,
without warning...
334
I'm Alfredo Marti.
335
Nice to meet you, I'm Jep,
but my house is this one.
336
I don't want to bother you.
337
How can I help you?
338
I'm Elisa De Santis' husband.
339
Did you have children?
340
No.
341
I couldn't.
342
But I could.
343
I could.
344
I'm sorry.
345
Forgive me.
346
She could too.
347
Elisa died.
348
Yesterday.
349
- Come in, I'll make some coffee.
- No.
350
It would hurt too much to see
what Elisa always desired.
351
Alfredo, if you need anything,
you know where I live.
352
Don't leave me alone, please.
Don't leave me.
353
Love, sitting in the corner,
was shy.
354
But not distracted.
355
She always loved you.
356
With immense focus.
357
We were married for 35 years...
358
but Elisa always loved you.
359
What are you saying?
360
Elisa and I went out together
when we were kids.
361
She left me, I think,
it was so long ago I don't remember.
362
Yes, she left you.
363
On September 8th, 1970.
364
Exactly...
365
Alfredo, you're distraught now,
that's normal.
366
I'm not distraught.
367
Elisa only ever loved one man.
368
- You.
- How can you say that?
369
I never saw Elisa again,
you were together for a lifetime!
370
I found a diary of hers, with a lock.
371
And I broke the lock off.
372
I write for a living, believe me...
373
when you write, you give life
to fantasies, imagination, lies...
374
I was only a good companion.
375
That's all she wrote about me.
376
35 years together...
377
and I'm mentioned in two lines
as a good companion.
378
Here, Alfredo.
379
What'll you do now?
380
What I've always done.
381
I'll live in adoration of her.
382
What's he doing?
383
Stop!
384
Jep!
385
Well done!
386
He made it!
387
- Have you seen my daughter?
- Your daughter? No.
388
Francesca!
389
Who are you?
390
Who am I?
391
- I am...
- No, you're nobody.
392
Nobody?
393
But I...
394
Francesca, where on earth were you?
395
I've been looking for you
for an hour!
396
- Are you sad, sir?
- No.
397
Sir is strange.
398
I don't like that,
I prefer you to be sad.
399
Are you going to bed?
400
You won't believe it, but last night
I went to bed at 22:30.
401
Now I don't know what to do.
402
Morning is an unknown object to me.
403
Unknown.
404
Sir can help me clean the house then.
405
- Sir can't, sir feels strange.
- Sir is a rascal.
406
"But what signified this turbid
seething of servile passions"
407
"seen through that silence
which surrounds Rome"
408
"with its nine circles
like a river of Tartarus?"
409
"Is there a new nation struggling
within the walls of the city?"
410
"From the crevices of that soil
a feverish vapour ascends like smoke"
411
"and works like a magic philtre
in the blood of some men"
412
"producing a form of heroic madness
unlike any other."
413
What do you think?
Shit, it's powerful, don't you think?
414
Why the hell do an adaptation
of D'Annunzio for the stage?
415
D'Annunzio has always been
paradigmatic...
416
You think that certain
intellectual feats give you dignity,
417
and that others are better than you,
but you're wrong!
418
Try and write something of your own,
like...
419
a feeling, or sorrow...
420
I've known you ages
but you've never been here.
421
Don't get big-headed, you've got
a room in a student flat...
422
Are you going out with
that gloomy girl you're always with?
423
I wish!
I've tried it on 7,000 times.
424
I've never gotten a kiss, not one!
425
- She's a bitch.
- No, she's not.
426
- She's complicated.
- She's a bitch.
427
Trust me, you're too kind.
428
I can tell her type from a mile off,
I don't even need to meet them.
429
- What are you doing with that hat?
- My morning exercise.
430
- That's exercise?
- Yes!
431
Do you know how many women
you've been with?
432
No, I'm rubbish at maths.
433
I've always been good at maths.
434
It's six, I introduced you to them.
435
Seven.
436
- Seven?
- Seven.
437
- When did number seven happen?
- Last summer.
438
A friend of my sister's back home
when I went to see my folks.
439
She runs a shop...
440
- She's nice.
- That means she's a dog.
441
What about you and Orietta?
442
- Who's Orietta?
- Don't you know?
443
She was at your house...
444
A real beauty.
445
At my age, a beauty isn't enough.
446
I might take up writing again.
447
That's great news!
448
Has something happened?
449
Why?
450
You want to write again after all
these years, something's happened.
451
Something always happens in Rome.
Nothing's happened.
452
What are you looking at?
453
Come here.
454
They met at university
10 days ago.
455
They haven't stopped kissing
for 10 days.
456
This generation of youths
horrifies me.
457
Supported by this State for years,
when they realise they're smart,
458
they go study or work in America or
London, forgetting about the support.
459
They have no civil vocation.
460
As a young girl, in the occupied arts
department, I oozed civil vocation.
461
- Is that so?
- Yes, why?
462
- Come off it...
- What do you know?
463
In those years you were in Naples
being a loafer with posh girls
464
and writing your only novelette.
465
I didn't notice that history
was being made.
466
Novelette? It was a masterpiece
of Italian literature!
467
I confirm that Jep and civil vocation
never got along,
468
he was lazy and the other hyperactive.
469
Romano, stop sucking up to your idol,
you're pathetic!
470
"The Human Apparatus"
was a narrow-minded, frivolous book
471
and pretentious too, like its title.
Jep knows that.
472
- That's why he stopped there.
- Sorry, what about you then?
473
I tried changing things
with literature.
474
I wrote 11 novels, and a book about
the Party's official history.
475
You're forgetting your contribution
to that reality show...
476
"Girl Farm."
477
Television can be
a very formative experience!
478
I always go when I'm invited.
479
I get my hands dirty, I try things...
480
I don't spend my life being a snob.
481
Are you saying that a socially
committed writer is advantaged,
482
and safeguarded,
compared to a novelist
483
who deals with, how can I say...
with feelings?
484
Of course she is!
485
The cause someone commits
their life to isn't secondary.
486
Like creating a family,
487
dedicating oneself with sacrifice to
raising and educating one's children.
488
Eusebio and I have four children,
we plan the future together.
489
I work hard
to be both a mother and a woman,
490
but at the end of the day, I feel
I've done something important.
491
So if we don't have children we should
contemplate the idea of suicide?
492
- I don't mean you, of course.
- She means me.
493
Dadina, I admire you greatly.
You're a badass.
494
Do you use "badass"
in any of your 11 novels?
495
Yes, I do, I try to be modern.
496
- Modernity is badass.
- De gustibus.
497
What great conviction!
498
Should I envy you or be repelled?
499
Yes, I have convictions.
I'm 53...
500
- You'd never know.
- Never.
501
I'm 53, I've suffered,
I bounced back,
502
and learned lots about life.
503
Well, I can see you have nothing
to say, at last.
504
I was drinking...
505
As we care about you,
we don't want to embarrass you.
506
You know, all this boastful talk,
507
all this serious ostentatiousness,
all this ego...
508
These harsh damning judgements
of yours
509
hide a certain fragility,
a feeling of inadequacy
510
and above all a series of untruths.
511
We care about you, we know you.
512
We also know our untruths
and for this, unlike you,
513
we end up talking about nonsense,
about trivial matters,
514
because we don't want
to revel in our pettiness.
515
What untruths are you talking about?
516
Everything I said is true,
it's what I am, what I believe in.
517
Please, I'm a gentleman.
Don't destroy my only certainty.
518
Tell me exactly what my lies are
and what my fragility is!
519
I'm a woman with balls, tell me!
520
"Woman with balls" would be too much
for any gentleman.
521
All right, Stefania, you asked for it.
In random order:
522
Your civil vocation during
your student days went unnoticed.
523
But another vocation of yours
is remembered by many,
524
the one practiced by you then,
in the university toilets.
525
You wrote about the Party because
you were its leader's mistress.
526
And your 11 novels,
527
published by a small publishing house
subsidised by the Party,
528
reviewed by minor Party-affiliated
newspapers,
529
are insignificant,
everyone says so.
530
I'm not saying my novelette
was any better,
531
I agree with you there.
532
Your relationship with Eusebio...
533
What relationship? Eusebio
loves Giordano, everyone knows.
534
He has for years.
535
They lunch every day
at the Pantheon, under the coat rack,
536
like sweethearts under an oak tree.
You all know but turn a blind eye.
537
Your dedication to your children,
with all the sacrifices entailed...
538
You work all week in TV,
go out every night,
539
even on Mondays, when popper
dealers don't even venture out.
540
You're never with your children,
not even on the long holidays you take.
541
And plus you have a butler, a waiter,
542
a cook, a chauffeur
who drives the kids to school,
543
three babysitters, so...
544
how and when exactly
do you make any sacrifices?
545
These are the untruths and fragility
I'm talking about.
546
Stefania, mother and woman.
547
You're 53, with a life in tatters,
like the rest of us.
548
Instead of acting superior
and treating us with contempt,
549
you should look at us
with affection.
550
We're all on the brink of despair,
551
all we can do
is look each other in the face,
552
keep each other company,
joke a little, don't you agree?
553
Son of a bitch!
554
Egidio!
555
Bastard!
I haven't seen you in 30 years!
556
- I need to talk to you.
- Later! I'm busy, can't you see?
557
- Is this still your place?
- Luckily not, I sold it.
558
I'm still the manager though.
559
You're famous! You're always
in the gossip rags.
560
You're at all the VIP parties,
always with a girl!
561
You never come here...
562
Get lost, will you?
We're having a serious talk!
563
- Are you married?
- Married, divorced.
564
- I've got a daughter, Ramona.
- Did you have to call her Ramona?
565
You artists are all the same!
566
I tell you I have a daughter
and you complain about her name!
567
What's wrong with "Ramona"?
568
Nothing, it's a name that implies
ambitions...
569
There's my daughter, you see?
570
She makes me so mad,
I've told her a million times!
571
You're too old for this!
572
Now these hot young Polish girls
rule the scene.
573
They're experts at turning tricks.
574
She's 42 and she wants to be
a sophisticated stripper.
575
But the world's no longer
sophisticated. Right, Jep?
576
I know, only you and I are.
577
That's right, goddammit!
578
But she wants to keep doing
this job, for the money.
579
I don't know why she always
needs fucking money.
580
- For drugs?
- I wish, we'd have a common interest.
581
She doesn't even drink beer.
582
I don't know what she spends
her money on, she's always broke.
583
- Do I seem like a loser?
- No, why?
584
Because I can hear myself talk,
I sound like a loser.
585
I'm nearly 70 and I have to work
till 6 in the morning every day.
586
I swapped cocaine for heroin
15 years ago.
587
What an asshole!
A heroin junkie at 50!
588
Could I be more of a loser?
589
But I'm not important,
it's her I worry about, I love her.
590
And I'm no loser there,
I'm a father.
591
And like all fathers, I'm worried.
592
What'll she do in a few years?
593
She can't be a stripper at 50!
594
- Why don't you help her?
- Me?
595
Don't you know any rich guys
who want a beautiful wife?
596
We could change her name,
that's no problem.
597
You'd do me a big favour.
598
I'm a writer, not a pimp.
599
Sorry, I was a bit vulgar.
600
Daddy's little girl, this is
my good friend, Jep Gambardella.
601
I'll leave you to it,
I need the toilet.
602
Be right back!
603
- Hi, I'm Jep.
- Ramona.
604
If you want a girl, get a Pole.
605
Are you kidding?
606
Who wants a girl?
Not me.
607
I really am an old friend
of your father.
608
- Dad has no friends.
- He used to.
609
When I came to Rome,
I loved coming here.
610
Your father was a nice guy.
611
He taught me loads of things,
such as: vodka is uncouth.
612
How useful!
613
He asked me to find you a husband.
614
He's obsessed.
I'm not looking for a husband.
615
Well, you should be.
616
- A family's a beautiful thing.
- I know.
617
But I'm not cut out
for beautiful things.
618
What's wrong?
619
I feel old.
620
You're no spring chicken.
621
Madame Ardant!
622
Excuse me.
623
You're excused.
624
May I...
625
say something...
626
a bit cheeky?
627
Please do.
628
When I saw you...
629
in "The Woman Next Door"...
630
I fell in love with you.
631
May I say something cheeky too?
632
Certainly.
633
I would've liked to have been
the woman next door.
634
Why?
635
To die of love.
636
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
637
De Oliveira is older than me
638
and he still makes films.
639
I want to make another film too.
640
What would this new film be about?
641
Well, after...
642
32 films which, all in all,
had nothing important to say...
643
I'd like to leave behind
a very simple concept.
644
Maestro, nothing important?
645
You forever influenced
the imagination of millions of people.
646
What would
this very simple concept be?
647
I'd like to tell my viewers:
648
Respect your curiosity.
649
Indulge it.
650
Many restrain it.
651
Why?
652
Because they're lazy
apathetic moralists,
653
they're sceptics.
654
And... ignorant as well.
655
What was cinema for you?
656
Cinema...
657
is a chance to survive...
658
the disappointments
that reality hands us every day.
659
In truth...
660
time, in defining reality,
661
renders it disappointing.
662
But if reality is disjointed,
broken apart...
663
re-examined...
664
re-elaborated...
665
it can become a wonderful sight.
666
Does real life not offer
this same wonderful sight?
667
There's only one circumstance
668
in which reality measures up to cinema.
669
When?
670
When love bursts in.
671
In that moment, time no longer beats
with the same rhythm of reality.
672
Want to know what my next film
will be about?
673
I'd be honoured.
674
It's about a girl.
675
Whose eyes change colour
every single time
676
she opens and closes them.
677
She becomes famous,
678
people adore her though
they've never heard her say a word.
679
Just silence...
680
and these eyes.
681
Blue...
682
green...
683
black.
684
Then blue again.
685
Fascinating.
686
Know where this idea came from?
687
From my first fascination
688
which wasn't for a girl, no...
689
It was for...
690
the first traffic light
installed in Milan
691
at the intersection
of Piazza del Duomo and Via Torino.
692
I believe it was on April 12, 1925.
693
My father put me on his shoulders
because there was a crowd...
694
Can you imagine? A crowd...
695
gathered to see a traffic light.
696
What a beauty...
697
what a great beauty.
698
- This is going to be a great interview.
- Tell me...
699
is Dadina still the editor
of your paper?
700
Yes.
701
Dadina and I had a tempestuous affair.
702
But it happened ages ago.
703
Dadina...
704
was an amazing and mysterious lover.
705
Her mysteriousness made me crazy
with jealousy, of course.
706
I can assure you that Dadina was...
707
was a woman who kept her lovers
awake at night.
708
- Don't include that please.
- I'm a gentleman.
709
That's my only certainty.
710
- Gambardella?
- Yes?
711
- Do you have a cigarette?
- Of course.
712
- Spying on me?
- No, I was going to knock.
713
- When?
- When you were more relaxed.
714
- What brings you here?
- Nothing, I'm just curious.
715
- I told you what I think.
- I've no hidden agenda.
716
Do you think every guy
who comes near you wants sex?
717
Perhaps they just want to talk,
718
driven by simple and harmless
curiosity.
719
- That's never happened to me.
- It has now.
720
Wouldn't armbands be more
comfortable?
721
Yes, but they irritate my armpits.
722
Any plans for lunch?
723
I'm going to my mum's with my dad.
724
So where's the dog?
725
What dog?
726
People buy houses like this
so they can have dogs.
727
I had a Labrador, but 9 years ago
he got fed up and left me.
728
Labradors are dumb.
729
And Cocker Spaniels are dumb too.
730
Good morning.
731
This is what you call rhythm.
732
Hi, Jep.
733
Hi, Antonello.
734
- You know Venditti?
- I know everyone.
735
It must be very satisfying
knowing so many people!
736
You're guaranteed to be unhappy.
737
Have people let you down?
738
I've let them down.
739
Andrea! Are you with your mum?
740
- She's parking.
- How are you?
741
Not well.
742
Proust says that death
may come to us this afternoon.
743
Proust is scary.
744
Not tomorrow, not in a year,
but this afternoon.
745
But it's evening already
so it'd be tomorrow afternoon.
746
Turgenev said:
"Death looked at me, noticing me."
747
Don't take these writers
so seriously!
748
Who should I take seriously then?
749
Nothing, apart from the menu,
of course.
750
Things are too complicated to be
understood by one individual.
751
Just because you don't understand
doesn't mean nobody can.
752
- Your reply?
- My reply?
753
- Jep!
- Hello, Viola.
754
- Good evening.
- Viola.
755
Darling, why don't you
get a table for us?
756
How does he seem?
757
- He's better.
- Good, very good.
758
He's much better, I'm so happy!
759
- Dinner on Thursday?
- Of course!
760
On Thursday I'm inexplicably free.
761
Did you hear about Valentina Lemme?
She's dating her personal trainer.
762
Really? It doesn't show.
763
- I invited her anyway.
- Are you sure?
764
She's nasty, you know.
She's like the devil!
765
Really? You think so?
766
I see her at yoga twice a week.
767
- You'll come?
- Of course.
768
- See you Thursday.
- Okay.
769
Goodbye.
770
Watch that table carefully,
but don't let them notice you looking.
771
Waiter? Champagne, please.
Cristal.
772
You can't imagine how much one learns
773
by living alongside
a cluster of religious institutes.
774
So that was your first time?
775
Yes, he didn't think he'd been good,
776
too quick, he said.
777
So, out of anger or to let off steam,
I'm not sure which,
778
he got a football
and played with it furiously!
779
And you?
780
I didn't enjoy making love with him,
781
but seeing him with a football
was an unforgettable thing!
782
He became really good,
he played on the national team.
783
Your dad said you spend everything
you earn.
784
What on? You can tell me.
785
Maybe one day. But why didn't you
write another book?
786
Because I went out too much
at night.
787
Rome makes you waste a lot of time.
788
It's distracting.
Writing requires focus and peace.
789
That's not much of an answer.
790
You have plenty of peace here,
it's like being in the country.
791
I wrote in short spurts.
I was a sprint-style writer.
792
I told you about my first time...
793
but you've told me nothing.
It's your turn now.
794
On an island...
one summer.
795
I was...
796
18, she was 20.
797
At the lighthouse, at night.
798
I went to kiss her,
she turned away.
799
I was disappointed.
800
But then she turned to look at me.
801
She brushed me with her lips...
802
she smelled of flowers.
803
I didn't move,
I wasn't able to move.
804
Then she took a step back...
805
and said...
806
She took a step back.
807
And said...
808
I'm going home, it's late.
809
Want to come to a party
tomorrow night?
810
Outstanding!
811
Did you want us to die
of fright tonight?
812
You won't believe it,
but I love knife throwers.
813
A true likeness,
especially the hips.
814
A masterpiece, Geronimo.
It'll look great on the mantelpiece.
815
Geronimo, you've moved me.
816
In the depths of my intimacy,
you moved me.
817
God bless you, Jep!
818
This is Ramona.
819
What a unique and marvellous creature.
820
- Is he taking the piss?
- It's hard to know.
821
I was being honest.
822
I'm just sorry you missed
Geronimo D.
823
- What a tragedy!
- Come in, make yourselves at home.
824
- Who is that asshole?
- Lillo De Gregorio.
825
The greatest modern art collector
in this debauched country.
826
What's Jep's floozy friend wearing?
827
I don't know.
828
Jep's proving to be a disappointment.
829
- Good evening, countess.
- Hello, you're looking well.
830
I wish I could say that same
about the count. Hello, ladies!
831
Trying to kill me, you troglodyte?
832
You dickhead! What have you done?
833
You served 8 euro sparkling wine!
834
You think this is
your cousin's birthday party?
835
You piece of shit!
836
You piece of shit!
837
Bring out the Cristal now
to make good!
838
Go!
839
You piece of shit!
840
Where's the butler?
841
This love that's blasphemous.
842
Corrupt.
843
Inert, haughty,
844
polyphonic, elegiac, diaconal,
postulatory.
845
In essence, an ineligible love.
846
She blushes and says:
847
"Forgive me, I didn't know
you loved me so much."
848
"My ignorance is obscene."
849
He looks at her, reassuringly,
and says:
850
"Let me defend our love."
851
How's that for the start
of the second act?
852
You've written a pile of shit.
853
Are you stupid?
You're distracting my artist.
854
Dad, we're having fun.
855
- Alfio fell down.
- Alfio, I'll deal with you later.
856
Carmelina, come and do some work.
857
Mum, I want to play here.
858
- Has this human being gone mad?
- We'll sort it out.
859
- I'm not coming, I'm staying here.
- You don't mean that.
860
Europe's greatest gallery owners
are outside.
861
If you show them what you can do
then ours will be a happy family.
862
But I'm already happy,
I want to be a vet one day.
863
Get to bed, you two!
864
My kids are going to bed,
it's late for them.
865
- Come.
- I'll go to bed too.
866
I'm a kid too.
867
That girl was crying.
868
Nonsense!
That girl earns millions!
869
Excuse me a moment.
870
Hi, Stefano.
871
Hi.
872
- The catering's gone downhill.
- Rome's gone downhill.
873
Steeply downhill!
874
Do you have the case with you?
875
- I always do.
- You up for it?
876
Anything's better than staying here.
877
See that?
878
Stefano has the keys to Rome's
most beautiful buildings.
879
Is he a porter?
880
No, he's not a porter.
881
He's friends with princesses.
882
Are you ready?
883
Come with me.
884
I don't have it.
885
I told you I don't have it,
so why keep insisting?
886
Stefano...
887
Good evening, Princesses.
888
Good evening.
889
You look like an old child.
890
How come you have all these keys?
891
Because...
892
I'm a trustworthy person.
893
You see? It looked huge,
but it's tiny.
894
Stay still, I'll take a photo of you.
Don't move.
895
That's no good.
Laugh.
896
Got it?
897
Yes, that's good.
898
Many people think that a funeral
899
is a fortuitous event,
without any rules.
900
That's not true.
901
A funeral is a high-society event
<i>par excellence.</i>
902
You must never forget
that at a funeral
903
you are appearing on stage.
904
Nice.
905
Nice, but try the other one.
906
You must patiently wait
for the relatives to disperse.
907
Once you are sure
that all the guests are seated...
908
only at that point, may you
offer your condolences to the family.
909
In this way, everyone will see you.
910
You take the mourner's hands,
911
and rest yours on their arms.
912
You whisper something to them,
a comforting phrase,
913
said with authority.
914
For example:
915
"In the days to come,
when you feel the void,"
916
"I want you to know
that you can always count on me."
917
The public will ask...
918
"What's Jep Gambardella saying?"
919
This is definitely the right dress.
920
You're allowed to retire
to a corner by yourself,
921
as if contemplating your sorrow.
922
However, another matter
must be approached with shrewdness.
923
The chosen place needs to be isolated
but clearly visible to the public.
924
Besides, a performance is good
when it is devoid of any superfluity.
925
So, the fundamental rule:
one must never cry at a funeral.
926
You must never steal the show
from the family's sorrow.
927
That is forbidden.
928
Because it is immoral.
929
Viola.
930
In the days to come,
when you feel the void,
931
you can always count on me.
932
Now I ask Andrea's friends
933
to come forward,
934
so that the coffin
may be carried outside.
935
Your back!
936
It was nice not making love.
937
It was nice loving each other.
938
I'd forgotten what loving someone
was about, I'd forgotten that.
939
I spend all my money to cure myself.
940
Your breakfast.
941
Come on, get up, today I'm taking you
to see a sea monster.
942
Your breakfast.
943
Five more minutes.
944
Can you see the sea?
945
Where?
946
On the ceiling.
947
Yes, I can see it.
948
Who's going to look after you now?
949
I'm sorry about your daughter.
950
My condolences.
951
I spent all my summers
952
making plans for September.
953
Not any longer.
954
Now I spend my summers
remembering the good intentions
955
which vanished.
956
In part because of laziness,
in part because of carelessness.
957
What's wrong with feeling nostalgic?
958
It's the only distraction left for
those who've no faith in the future!
959
Without rain...
960
August is coming to an end
961
and September isn't arriving.
962
And I'm so ordinary!
963
But there's no need to worry.
964
It's all right, it's okay.
965
Bravo!
966
Thank you.
967
Did you like the show?
968
People clapped, aren't you happy?
969
No, I'm not happy.
970
Why'd you stop?
Take me home.
971
Get out, I'm not taking you.
972
You're a shithead like all the others.
973
Actually, you're worse
because you're good.
974
Romano...
975
come here.
976
Sit down.
977
Touch me.
978
In between my legs...
979
Goodness, look at all the seagulls!
980
Okay, shall we go?
981
What are you doing here?
982
Arturo!
983
Why are you here?
984
Don't you see?
I'm rehearsing my magic show.
985
This is tomorrow's special number:
the vanishing giraffe.
986
You can make this giraffe vanish?
987
Of course I can make
the giraffe vanish!
988
Then make me vanish too.
989
Jep, do you think that if I could
really make people vanish
990
I'd still be here at my age
playing these silly games?
991
It's just a trick.
992
It's just a trick!
993
It's just a trick!
994
Romano, how did it go?
995
Well, they clapped.
996
I'm glad.
997
- So why are you so sad?
- I'm not sad.
998
What's with the giraffe?
999
For a magic show.
I'll come and see you tomorrow.
1000
I'm not doing the show tomorrow.
1001
Why not? You said it went well.
1002
I'm leaving, I'm going back
to my hometown, for good.
1003
I won't even pack up my things,
I'll leave it all.
1004
I've lived in this city
for 40 years.
1005
And in the end I thought...
1006
the only person
who deserved a goodbye
1007
was you.
1008
So you're leaving?
1009
Romano... why are you leaving?
1010
Rome has really disappointed me.
1011
Bye, Jep.
1012
See?
1013
- Want some coffee?
- No, thanks. I know you're busy.
1014
I need to ask you something.
1015
Go ahead.
1016
Why did Elisa leave me?
1017
I don't know.
1018
Didn't she say anything about it
in her diary?
1019
No, I don't think so.
1020
Would you be offended
if I asked to read it?
1021
No, I wouldn't.
1022
In fact, I'd understand.
1023
But I'm afraid I can't let you read it.
1024
Why not?
1025
Because a few days after the funeral,
I threw it away.
1026
May I introduce you to my girlfriend?
1027
Hello, my name's Polina.
1028
Like Polina in "The Gambler"
by Dostoyevsky.
1029
What are you doing tonight?
1030
Nothing.
1031
Polina's going to finish ironing...
1032
then we'll drink a glass of red wine.
1033
We'll watch some television
and go to bed.
1034
What about you?
1035
I'll have a lot of drinks, but not
so many as to become unruly.
1036
And then...
1037
when you'll be getting up
1038
I'll be going to bed.
1039
What lovely people you are!
1040
I love doing the train!
1041
I'll screw you.
1042
"Who am I?"
1043
That's how
one of Breton's novels began.
1044
And of course in the book
there's no reply.
1045
- Did you hear about Viola?
- What?
1046
She donated everything
to the church.
1047
She works in the parish
and is going to volunteer in Africa.
1048
The trains at our parties
are the best ones in Rome!
1049
- You think so?
- I do.
1050
They're the best because
they go nowhere.
1051
- Well?
- It's wonderful, thank you.
1052
Come on, it's all gone.
1053
Tell me why you left me, please.
1054
I want an explanation, please!
1055
Go away!
Get out! Get out!
1056
You see all these people?
1057
They can't do anything.
1058
But I know how to do something.
1059
We know how to do something.
1060
How sweet!
1061
- Who's that, your mother?
- Who?
1062
Yes... that's my mother...
1063
So...
1064
So...
1065
- So...
- So...
1066
So...
1067
So...
1068
So...
1069
They've been asking me for years
why I don't write another novel.
1070
But look at these people.
1071
This wildlife!
1072
This is my life
and it's nothing.
1073
Flaubert wanted to write a book
about nothing but he failed,
1074
so how could I?
1075
It's good.
Thanks, rascal.
1076
- Ron Sweet.
- Hello, I'm Gambardella.
1077
Sorry I'm late.
1078
We've been finalising the details
for tonight's opening.
1079
- It's a pleasure.
- The pleasure's mine.
1080
- Come in.
- Thanks.
1081
What inspired this exhibition?
1082
It wasn't my idea
to do this photo exhibition.
1083
It was my father's idea.
1084
When I was born, he starting taking
photos of me, every day.
1085
One photo per day.
1086
He never forgot, not even once.
1087
From the age of 14 upwards,
I continued.
1088
I photographed myself every day.
1089
Go ahead.
1090
I love hot-air balloons.
1091
Good God,
did we really have to invite her?
1092
Mum, she's my mother-in-law.
1093
She resembles
a wonderful primitive animal.
1094
A primitive animal
with infinite patrimonial assets.
1095
Where are the meatballs?
1096
Stop, don't!
1097
That mozzarella's blue.
1098
You're an asshole.
1099
Such a fool...
1100
Tell me something,
who is that cardinal?
1101
- That's Bellucci.
- Bellucci?
1102
- The one in line to be...
- Exactly. The papal throne awaits him.
1103
I met him
at Giada Ricci's carnival party.
1104
Rumour has it that he used to be
Europe's best exorcist.
1105
- Pulling my leg again?
- No.
1106
I never joke about the devil.
1107
Do you know I'm very, very bored?
1108
We're having a great, great time.
1109
Cardinal,
when will The Saint arrive in Rome?
1110
On Thursday,
but please don't call her The Saint.
1111
She is a Saint but not technically.
1112
She'll become one.
There's no doubt about it.
1113
The Congregation will decide.
1114
First soak the mushrooms
in warm water.
1115
Then you cut up the duck.
1116
Remove the skin
1117
and put it in a pan
with one spoon of oil.
1118
Cook it on a high flame
for 15 minutes.
1119
At that point...
1120
Cardinal, do you remember me?
Lello Cava.
1121
We met at Giada Ricci's party.
1122
I was dressed as an escort.
1123
Come, they're starting to serve lunch.
1124
I'd like you meet my writer friend,
Jep Gambardella.
1125
A writer!
1126
This country needs writers.
1127
I thought it needed more priests.
1128
That too...
1129
The two are not dissimilar...
1130
they both require a vocation.
1131
Help.
1132
- May I ask you a question?
- Of course, my dear man.
1133
Well, for some time now...
1134
from a spiritual point of view...
1135
Skunk hunt?
1136
Of course, I'll lead the way!
1137
I know the Tebaldi grounds well.
1138
Jep Gambardella, the king
of socialites! You're losing it.
1139
I've been losing it for 40 years.
It's a steady decline.
1140
This is it, we're here!
1141
Come this way!
1142
This way, come!
1143
Here!
1144
Skunk hunting, what a shitty idea.
1145
Lello, do skunks really stink?
1146
How should I know?
1147
- How much prosecco did you drink?
- 117 glasses.
1148
Dickhead,
what would you do without me?
1149
We're here, come!
1150
There are tons of skunks here.
1151
Hic sunt puteolae.
1152
Come, come see the skunks.
1153
Won't you come see the skunks?
1154
<i>I will steal you...</i>
1155
<i>From everyone who keeps you far</i>
1156
<i>From me</i>
1157
<i>I will take you</i>
1158
<i>With my boat toward lands unknown</i>
1159
<i>To you</i>
1160
<i>You will get to know</i>
1161
<i>The freedom to love
that you were never given</i>
1162
<i>I will steal you</i>
1163
<i>You'll see, I will manage</i>
1164
<i>My love</i>
1165
<i>If you so desire</i>
1166
Tell me something, Stefania.
1167
Have we ever slept with each other?
1168
Of course not!
1169
That's an awfully big mistake!
1170
We must make amends, immediately.
1171
Idiot.
1172
Thank goodness.
1173
We still have something nice
to do together.
1174
The future is marvellous, Stefania.
1175
To be honest, Catellani hasn't had
many brushed fabrics in recent years.
1176
In my opinion, Rebecchi's still
the best tailor in Rome.
1177
- Who are you?
- A hard-working man.
1178
One who, while you play the artist
and have fun with your friends,
1179
keeps this country going.
1180
I keep this country going,
1181
but many people
haven't understood that yet.
1182
Imagine that, Dadina,
Giulio Moneta was my neighbour.
1183
One of the world's 10 most wanted men
and I didn't know.
1184
Heard from Romano?
1185
He vanished, understandably so.
1186
He cut off ties with everyone.
1187
You've changed,
you're always thinking.
1188
But not about the usual bullshit
that we laugh over.
1189
Maybe I should do what Romano did.
1190
I'm not fit for this life or this city.
1191
Nobody's fit for anything, dammit.
Take it from the queen of misfits.
1192
Everything around me is dying.
1193
People who are younger than me,
things...
1194
All before my eyes and I...
1195
And you're suffering.
And you don't understand.
1196
How's the soup, Little Jep?
1197
The soup's good.
1198
Why did you call me Little Jep?
No one's called me that for centuries.
1199
Because a friend,
every now and again,
1200
needs to make their friend
feel like they did as a child.
1201
How can I make you feel
like a little girl?
1202
You don't need to,
I feel like a little girl every day!
1203
I've seen the world from
that viewpoint for 60 years.
1204
As soon as you finish your soup
I'll give you some killer news.
1205
Tell me, I'm dying to know.
1206
You know Sister Maria, the missionary,
the one they call The Saint?
1207
Yes, she's coming to Rome
to receive some honour.
1208
Exactly. In all her life,
she's only given three interviews.
1209
- Yours will be memorable.
- Yeah sure, think of Giulio Moneta!
1210
This is different.
1211
She studied in Italy
and speaks Italian.
1212
She read your book and loved it.
1213
She wants to meet you so I organised
a dinner party at your house tomorrow.
1214
- Did I do well?
- You did very well.
1215
Get your interview with
that big-headed Bracco done today
1216
and tomorrow
we'll focus on The Saint.
1217
Well well, Pappardella!
1218
It's Gambardella...
1219
As I always say to my clients:
1220
Beautiful bodies don't last,
they're apparitions.
1221
- Big words, Bracco.
- Truthful words.
1222
I have a certain knowhow
that makes the human circus go round.
1223
Which is?
1224
Access to beauty.
1225
One.
1226
- How are you?
- Fine.
1227
Just got back from India,
I had amazing dysentery.
1228
Come to my divorce party, I'll have
burlesque dancers on elephants.
1229
Of course.
What present would you like?
1230
One thing, peace in the Middle East.
1231
- I'll try.
- Two.
1232
700 euros.
1233
Here you go.
1234
Yes, darling.
1235
Perhaps...
1236
I was thinking, my mouth...
1237
I'm scared, I've never done it before,
professor.
1238
Don't call me professor.
Call me "my friend" or "my love."
1239
We all need love.
1240
What star sign are you,
deeply intense lady?
1241
- Aquarius.
- I knew it.
1242
Want to go back 30 years
1243
to when it rained in August?
Done.
1244
- 700.
- Three.
1245
Baby doll.
1246
- Hi.
- My baby doll.
1247
My boyfriend says
I don't really need it...
1248
We all need it.
1249
Your boyfriend is blinded by love
1250
and he can't see things as they are,
that's why.
1251
That's 700.
1252
- How's your mum?
- Fine.
1253
- Five.
- That's 700.
1254
You're plumper, darling.
You're always in my heart.
1255
- That's 700.
- Eight.
1256
Hello, honey.
As handsome as ever.
1257
- You're my pride and joy.
- Thanks.
1258
Eleven.
1259
- You've been to see Casagrande.
- I don't know who that is!
1260
You betrayed me.
1261
We're undertaking a journey,
and you've interrupted it.
1262
This is the last time.
1263
Go, go.
1264
Bye then.
1265
Full price.
1266
- Twelve.
- That's 1,200 euros.
1267
Professor,
I'm here for my hyperhidrosis.
1268
Where's this undesired perspiration?
1269
On my hands.
1270
- Pray for me, sister.
- You don't need my prayers.
1271
You don't know how much of my income
I must surrender to the tax man.
1272
Go on, sister.
1273
That'll be 700, sister.
1274
Tomorrow I'll have the honour
of dining with her.
1275
- At the Holy Father's?
- No.
1276
No, at Jep Gambardella's.
1277
You see, the Pope even invited
1278
the enclosed nuns.
1279
Sisters...
1280
Sisters...
1281
Hold on...
1282
Oh God!
1283
Sisters, sisters, sisters!
1284
Sisters, sisters...
Yes, perfect!
1285
Thanks... great.
1286
Ah, Red Cross nurses!
So fit!
1287
Okay, great...
What handsome young men!
1288
Great!
1289
Let's go!
1290
What'll we eat?
1291
- Carbonara and veal roulade.
- A light meal...
1292
The Saint weighs 11 kilos.
1293
If she's vegetarian?
1294
There's always AhÃ¨'s endive quiche.
That's vegetarian.
1295
Hello? Yes.
1296
Now you tell me?
How'll I fucking find the Odescalchis?
1297
- What's wrong?
- The Saint's assistant called me.
1298
The Saint would like
Count Odescalchi to come too,
1299
he treated her like family
when she was here.
1300
- Do you know him?
- Of course, but he's not in Rome.
1301
All the nobles are in London,
at Philip's great-niece's wedding.
1302
Hold on...
Let's call the Colonnas from Reggio.
1303
The nobles for hire? They're dead.
1304
- Nonsense, they're immortal.
- But they're not the Odescalchis.
1305
The Saint won't even notice,
70 years have gone by!
1306
The Colonnas are true aristocrats,
and aristocrats all look the same.
1307
True...
1308
<i>This piece of furniture
looks great..</i>
1309
<i>I'd never have thought
of putting it in the bathroom.</i>
1310
<i>It looks great,
like a new bathroom!</i>
1311
<i>Well done, Andrea!</i>
1312
Count Colonna speaking.
1313
Yes, we are available.
1314
For tonight...
1315
Short notice would entail
a small surcharge.
1316
Our rate is 250 euros per person
for the evening.
1317
Plus the cost of the car hire.
1318
No, I'm not sure...
1319
This would be somewhat
humiliating for us...
1320
We are willing to be hired...
1321
as the Colonnas from Reggio.
1322
But as for pretending to be
the Odescalchis...
1323
I don't know...
1324
We were at war for two centuries.
I feel it's immoral.
1325
Let me talk it over with my wife
Elisabetta.
1326
All right, ma'am.
1327
For this time, we'll go along with it.
1328
But we would appreciate it
1329
if you would supplement
the contribution.
1330
Cut at least twelve pieces of rabbit!
1331
Set aside the kidneys, liver, head...
1332
Gently brown it.
1333
Don't forget thyme,
laurel leaves, rosemary...
1334
Then red wine, Ligurian olives...
pine nuts.
1335
And after an hour,
you have Ligurian-style rabbit!
1336
Sister Maria, what convent
are you staying at?
1337
Actually, we're at the Hassler Hotel
at the Spanish Steps.
1338
To be honest, Sister Maria
finds it uncomfortable.
1339
Never heard the Hassler
described as uncomfortable!
1340
It's very comfortable but Sister Maria
isn't used to sleeping in a bed.
1341
She sleeps on the floor,
in a cardboard bed.
1342
Do you have any visits planned?
1343
Sister Maria will climb St John's
Basilica's Scala Sancta on her knees.
1344
- Have you?
- I'd have liked to, but...
1345
I have a bad knee...
1346
Orthopaedic problems
are unimportant,
1347
compared to the plenary indulgence
granted by the Scala Sancta.
1348
That's true!
1349
Another speciality
of mine is lamb with...
1350
Does Sister Maria still help
the sick?
1351
22 hours a day, every day.
1352
She washes them, feeds them...
You ought to see her.
1353
Despite her age,
she doesn't walk, she runs.
1354
She's inexhaustible!
1355
Now she's tired, but that's because
she's not with her patients.
1356
How old is she?
1357
She'll be 104 in October.
1358
- That's impressive.
- I thought she was older!
1359
Longevity too, like all things,
is not accidental.
1360
About Sister Maria's interview
with Jep...
1361
Her interview?
1362
There must be a mix-up...
1363
Sister Maria hasn't given
any interviews since 1971,
1364
after the reason
for her mission in Chad,
1365
was misunderstood by some.
1366
Of course, but considering
her admiration for Jep's work...
1367
You told me she enjoyed
"The Human Apparatus."
1368
She found it beautiful and fierce.
1369
Like the world of men.
1370
Great! There would be no risk
of any misunderstanding,
1371
Sister Maria can review the text...
1372
- No, I'm sorry.
- Don't insist.
1373
I don't wish to raise any false hopes,
1374
there's absolutely
no question of any interview.
1375
Sorry, but why do you always answer?
1376
Why not let Sister Maria talk?
1377
Madam...
1378
I took a vow of poverty.
1379
And you can't talk about poverty...
1380
you have to live it.
1381
Such true and real words!
Powerful words!
1382
Do you need anything, madam?
1383
- She needs the bathroom.
- It's on the left.
1384
The change of diet
isn't good for her.
1385
Sister Maria, in Mali, only eats
40 grams of plant roots a day.
1386
Me too sometimes, in the evening,
as a light meal,
1387
I have some splendid
roots with lemon.
1388
You clean the roots
by scraping them with a knife
1389
and you cut them into small chunks...
1390
Cardinal, remember when we met
at that wedding?
1391
You were there too...
1392
I felt the need to ask you
about matters close to my heart.
1393
Matters regarding faith...
1394
regarding the strength
of spirituality...
1395
But then you got distracted.
1396
You can ask me now.
1397
- No, I don't see the point.
- Why?
1398
I'd be very disappointed to discover
that you have no answers.
1399
I'm only saying it's a possibility...
1400
I think that...
1401
Never mind...
1402
I apologise for earlier.
1403
I'm afraid I was somewhat offensive.
1404
There is one question
I really want to ask you.
1405
Are the rumours about you true?
1406
That you were a truly great...
1407
exorcist?
1408
See you at the office.
1409
Sister Maria...
1410
Sister Maria!
1411
Where's Sister Maria?
1412
I thought she was with you.
1413
- She was with you.
- Yes, but then she went to you.
1414
We're going, thank you and goodbye.
1415
Sister Maria!
1416
- Sister Maria!
- Sister Maria!
1417
- Have you seen her?
- She's not there.
1418
Saint...
1419
Sister Maria!
1420
Saint...
1421
Saint!
1422
She's called Sister Maria.
1423
Sister Maria...
1424
Where has that bitch got to?
1425
These 550 euros
1426
have come at just the right time.
1427
It was a lovely evening too.
1428
Lovely evenings are others, Alceste.
1429
Sister Maria!
1430
Sister Maria!
1431
My goodness!
1432
Come, Elisabetta, let's go to bed.
1433
You go ahead, I'm going upstairs
for a moment.
1434
Don't be late.
1435
Countess,
we must put a stop to this.
1436
I'll lose my job
if I let you in every night.
1437
This isn't your home anymore.
1438
- It's a museum now.
- This will always be my home.
1439
<i>In this room, in 1930,</i>
1440
<i>Princess Antonietta gave birth
to her only daughter,</i>
1441
<i>Elisabetta Colonna of Reggio.</i>
1442
<i>The princess died
after giving birth.</i>
1443
<i>Young Elisabetta,
in these opulent rooms,</i>
1444
<i>had a happy and carefree childhood.</i>
1445
<i>But shortly after, the financial
hardship endured by Prince Erminio</i>
1446
<i>forced him to sell the property.</i>
1447
They're migrating west...
1448
but now they are resting.
1449
Did you know
1450
that I know the Christian names...
1451
of all of these birds?
1452
Why...
1453
did you never write another book?
1454
I was looking for the great beauty,
1455
but...
1456
I didn't find it.
1457
Do you know...
1458
why...
1459
I only eat roots?
1460
No, why?
1461
Because roots are important.
1462
Now there's something
I want to show you.
1463
<i>This is how it always ends.
With death.</i>
1464
<i>But first there was life.</i>
1465
<i>Hidden beneath the blah, blah, blah.</i>
1466
<i>It is all settled beneath
the chitter chatter and the noise.</i>
1467
<i>Silence and sentiment.</i>
1468
<i>Emotion and fear.</i>
1469
<i>The haggard, inconstant
splashes of beauty.</i>
1470
<i>And then the wretched squalor
and miserable humanity.</i>
1471
<i>All buried under the cover of the
embarrassment of being in the world.</i>
1472
<i>Elsewhere,
there is what lies beyond.</i>
1473
<i>I don't deal
with what lies beyond.</i>
1474
<i>Therefore...</i>
1475
<i>let this novel begin.</i>
1476
<i>After all...</i>
1477
<i>it's just a trick.</i>
1478
<i>Yes,</i>
1479
<i>it's just a trick.</i>
1480
