<i>Yumi's Cells 2</i>
3
<i>Episode 39: Laptop</i>
4
First place is mine! Mine!
5
Oh yeah! First place! First place!
6
The unique sweetness is gone. It's no fun!
7
Writer Kim Yumi, are you going through a hard
time? This is like a funeral march dragging on.
8
Why did you make a sequel? Just
end it if you don't have anything to say.
9
<i>I can't read this anymore. I'm leaving now.</i>
10
What?
11
<i>Oh yeah! First place!
The unique sweetness has disappeared.</i>
12
Everything is malicious comments.
13
It's because it's so popular. There are
no malicious comments if it's not popular.
14
But still, there are too many malicious comments these days.
15
It's because the ending is almost near. They
must be worried that it won't be a happy ending.
16
Don't worry too much about it, Writer.
You're going to give them a good ending.
17
A good ending?
18
Our company's employees are all looking forward to it, too.
19
Since you're not giving them any hints, they're
all in suspense wondering what the ending will be.
20
What will the ending be? I'm curious about that,
too! Won't you let me know what the ending will be?!
21
Cooking cell told me to bring this to you so you can gain some strength.
22
Bye!
23
The ending is coming.
<i>God Yumi! Let's have a legendary ending!!</i>
24
<i>Although you get the full support of everyone once you
become the top priority, it's not necessarily a good thing.</i>
25
Oh, no. What should she do?
26
She has to end it well.
27
What should she do if it doesn't go well?
28
- What if Yumi can't give a good ending?
- Stop it!
29
They said they're looking forward to a good ending.
30
If it's not a good ending, won't Yumi be ostracized?
31
I said stop it, please!
32
<i>This cell is always clinging on to the Prime Cell. Anxiety.</i>
33
If this doesn't go well, it's all over! We
used all the down payment to buy the house.
34
We got a huge loan!
35
If things go badly, how will we pay back the loan?
36
What to do? What will we do? What will we do?!
37
I said stop it!
38
I'm so anxious that I can't write!
39
You'll send me the manuscript tomorrow
morning before the wedding, right?
40
Ah, I should.
41
Miss Writer, fighting! I'll see you at the ceremonial hall.
42
Yes, fighting!
43
<i>Yumi was already pretty stressed because
she had to finish the manuscript for the sequel.</i>
44
<i>But the real incident occured the night before Yi Da's wedding.</i>
45
Reason! Emergency, emergency!
46
- What is it?
- I don't see the laptop!
47
Look for it. It must be somewhere.
48
It's not there!
49
<i>It's not in the place where she usually charges it?</i>
50
<i>No, it's not.</i>
51
<i>Then what about the table?</i>
52
<i>What about under the bed?</i>
53
<i>It's not there!</i>
54
<i>Maybe she put it in another bag before she left?</i>
55
<i>No!</i>
56
<i>Did it get mixed in with the recyclables?</i>
57
<i>I'm telling you it didn't!</i>
58
It's not here. It's gone.
59
How much of the manuscript is in the laptop?
60
Including the episode that I'm going to
upload tomorrow, it's 60 chapters in 6 episodes.
61
That much?! You didn't make a backup?
62
She definitely left it somewhere outside before she came home.
63
What places did she visit today?
64
<i>It's because the ending is almost near. They
must be worried that it won't be a happy ending.</i>
65
<i>There! She had the laptop up until then.</i>
66
Yes, Miss Writer?
67
- Your laptop?
- Yes.
68
We were looking at my laptop together
this morning and talking about the comments.
69
That was my laptop, though.
70
You didn't take your laptop out.
71
Did you lose it? <i>How?</i>
72
Yes, well...
73
I should look for it. I'll find it.
74
<i>You backed it up, right? As long as the manuscript is alright...</i>
75
Oh, of course!
76
Yes.
77
She must have really lost it.
78
Let's not despair!
79
For now, she can just go buy a new laptop tomorrow and rewrite it all!
80
Rewrite it all? 60 pages?!
81
Don't you have the outline in your head?
82
<i>In the end, Yumi couldn't find the
laptop up to the morning of the wedding.</i>
83
What will she do now? Everyone from the
publishing company is going to the wedding.
84
What will she do? What to do? Come up with an excuse.
85
There's no manuscript to upload today,
86
and there's no manuscript to upload next week
either. Even if she writes, there are malicious comments.
87
What do we do? They won't leaveâ
88
I'm not being the prime cell anymore.
89
Bye, guys.
90
Don't look for me ever again!
91
Goodbye!
92
- Writer!
- Oh, no!
93
<i>Writer abandoned her prime cell position and ran away.</i>
94
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>
95
Thank you.
96
Aigo, Writer Yumi! You made it?
97
Editor-in-Chief. Congratulations.
98
Thank you.
99
- Where's Yi Da?
- She's in the waiting room right now.
100
You finished by the deadline before you came, right?
101
- Yes.
- I'll read it after the ceremony.
102
I'm looking forward to the last chapter.
103
Yes.
104
Oh, yes. Excuse me.
105
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thank you.
106
<i>The groom's side</i>
107
<i>Kim Yumi</i>
108
Wow, Miss Yumi!
109
Oh, Bon Hui! Hello!
110
- It's been a long time. It's been so long!
- I know!
111
It's good to see you.
112
Wait, I heard that you're the one who set up the bride and groom.
113
They said that the groom is your editor-in-chief.
114
I didn't set them up.
115
<i>Really? He was a loser this time, too?</i>
116
<i>Yeah. He was the worst of the worst.</i>
117
<i>It's not like I'm betting on who's worse.</i>
118
<i>- Hey, I really got angry andâ
- Miss Writer.</i>
119
<i>Oh, Editor-in-Chief?</i>
120
<i>I saw you on my way to the publishing company.</i>
121
<i>Oh, I had plans with my friend, so...</i>
122
<i>I was just about to get up and leave anyway.</i>
123
<i>Yi Da, say hello. This is my
Editor-in-Chief. I talked about him a lot, right?</i>
124
<i>This is my former co-worker, Yi Da.</i>
125
<i>Hello, I'm Kang Yi Da.</i>
126
<i>Hello. I'm Ahn Dae Yong.</i>
127
<i>- You're the best!
- Pardon?</i>
128
<i>You're the person that chose our Yumi's work.</i>
129
<i>I always told Yumi that you've got a great eye..</i>
130
<i>You've really got an amazing eye for writers.</i>
131
<i>That's because Miss Writer's writing isâ</i>
132
<i>You're the best! Really the best!</i>
133
<i>What is this? Who is that cute creature?</i>
134
<i>She said she's Kang Yi Da.</i>
135
<i>Let's save that. Kang Yi Da.
[Kang Yi Da]</i>
136
<i>Her name is Kang Yi Da.</i>
137
<i>Cute Best (Jjang) Yi Da.</i>
138
<i>The line is perfect, too!</i>
139
<i>- Hello!
- Hello.</i>
140
<i>Hello, I'm Ahn Dae Yong who greeted
you last time. You remember me, right?</i>
141
<i>Oh, this ahjusshi?</i>
142
<i>Yes, of course. Hello, how have you been?</i>
143
<i>I have a meeting nearby today.</i>
144
<i>If it's okay with you, shall we have lunch together?</i>
145
<i>Julie Literature Editor-in-Chief Ahn Dae Yong</i>
146
<i>Yes, that sounds good.</i>
147
<i>What's with this ahjusshi? It doesn't suit him to leave an emoticon.</i>
148
<i>He's cute.</i>
149
I only introduced them to each other. I found out later
that they were dating each other without me knowing.
150
What's with that? Oh, you also set Ruby up with her boyfriend.
151
I also only introduced Ruby to him,
and they started dating on their own.
152
Then I should stick by you from now on if I'm going to get married.
153
Oh right! We're catching up and forgot we
haven't even given our congratulatory money yet.
154
I'm in charge of giving them the envelopes from the marketing team.
155
<i>Yu Ba Bi</i>
156
Team Leader Yu can't come, so he put me in charge of it.
157
Ah...
158
Do you know that he's going to an overseas branch?
159
- An overseas branch?
- Yes, he was assigned to Singapore.
160
He said he couldn't come because he's leaving
today. So he asked me to bring the envelopes.
161
<i>What's this? This is ridiculous.</i>
162
Writer Cell ran away, and Love isn't here.
163
Is there a cell village without a prime cell?
164
- Reason.
- Huh?
165
Is our Yumi really living well right now?
166
The wedding was broken off, and she's missing the deadline.
167
Hey, you can't be like that. Today is Yi Da's
wedding ceremony. Let's not ruin the mood.
168
I'm saying that I'm sad. Everyone else gets married so easily.
169
- Is there anything else?
- No, that's everything.
170
I just left. I'll call you when I get to the airport.
171
Okay.
172
Hello?
173
<i>- This is the cafÃ© at the Baekseok-dong intersection.
</i>- Oh, yes.
174
Hello.
175
I'm calling the number that was left on the coupon.
176
Ah, yes. What is it?
177
She's a writer. I thought she would be looking for it.
178
Yes, that's right. She would be looking for it.
179
I'm glad that I had your phone number.
180
Yes, thank you.
181
She must be at the wedding right now.
182
Is it okay to head to the airport now?
183
Oh, yes.
184
No, wait! One moment. I've got to stop somewhere.
185
<i>This is my first request.</i>
186
<i>More than anything else, please be considerate of each other.</i>
187
In the passion absorbed by each other's charms, the other's strengths
188
make you happy...
189
Are they going to give us steak?
190
Or galbitang?
191
I want to eat steak.
192
- Oppa.
- Hm?
193
By the way, isn't that woman in the pink
dress pretty? The one on the bride's side?
194
- You're way prettier, Ruby.
- What are you saying? That's obvious.
195
Did I say something too obvious?
196
Hey.
197
Shh.
198
Let's listen courteously to the good words.
199
- Yes, sir.
<i>- The husband has to love his wife</i>
200
<i>and the wife has to love her husband in order to become a true family.</i>
201
<i>Alright, everyone. Listen up!</i>
202
Writer has run away.
203
We are in a bind. There is no place to retreat to.
204
Yumi couldn't meet the deadline today, and
she lost the manuscript for the next three weeks.
205
She doesn't even have any idea about her story's ending.
206
- Oh, no.
- What should she do?
207
All that she has left is a missed deadline, malicious comments,
208
and the interest on her loan.
209
So today's strategy...
210
the thirty-six strategy!
<i>(Thirty-Six Strategems: "If all else fails, retreat.")</i>
211
- Is that a strategy?
- Thirty-six?
212
As soon as the ceremony ends, Yumi will leave the ceremony hall,
213
turn her phone off, and go to Mom's house.
- What?
214
And she'll disappear!
215
Until when? Until Writer comes back and she comes up with a plan!
216
That's the only way that Writer Kim Yumi will live today!
217
<i>What makes love complete isn't passion...</i>
218
<i>Oh, wait! It's Ba Bi. It's Ba Bi!</i>
219
<i>Love is...</i>
220
<i>Yumi. How are you?</i>
221
<i>You're probably attending the wedding right now.</i>
222
<i>I was contacted because you left your laptop at the cafe.</i>
223
<i>I came to get it so I could bring it to the wedding,</i>
224
<i>but I don't think I can make it because traffic is so backed up.</i>
225
What time did you say your flight was?
226
<i>I'm leaving for Singapore today, you see.</i>
227
â« <i>Did you doze off last night again?</i> â«
228
â« <i>Are you standing at the end of your path?</i> â«
229
â« <i>Close your eyes and come into my arms</i> â«
230
â« <i>Everything is all right</i> â«
231
â« <i>I can't even express it in words</i> â«
232
<i>So I'm sorry, Yumi,</i>
233
<i>but I left your laptop in the airport locker.</i>
234
<i>I was trying to help you, but I ended up inconveniencing you. I'm sorry.</i>
235
â« <i>One day I'll hold you tightly in my arms</i> â«
236
<i>You know that I'm always supporting Writer Kim Yumi, right?</i>
237
<i>Even if we've broken up, that won't change.</i>
238
<i>I hope you write good stories. Goodbye.</i>
239
â« <i>I will become the moon just for you</i> â«

258
Yumi!
259
- Oh, Wung!
- My meeting ended late. The ceremony isn't over, right?
260
The ceremony is over. Everyone's eating. Go on and head inside.
261
Wait, where are you going?
262
To go find something.
263
- What?
- My laptop. I lost my laptop. Today's my deadline.
264
- See you later.
- Yumi. Yumi!
265
â« <i>Cause you are my life</i> â«
266
â« <i>I'm just shining on your night</i> â«
267
You can take my car...
268
<i>Terminal 1</i>
269
â« <i>I'm just shining on your night</i> â«
270
<i>It's locker number 14. You know the passcode, right?</i>
271
<i>Will you end your locker usage and remove your items?
Yes. No.</i>
272
<i>Please wait a moment</i>
273
<i>1224</i>
274
<i>Just a moment, please.</i>
275
<i>Thank you for your use. Please close the
door completely after removing your items.</i>
276
<i>Too much time has gone by. He's probably already on the plane.</i>
277
<i>Let's at least leave him a text message
so he can see it when he gets there.</i>
278
<i>Departures</i>
279
<i>I found the laptop. Things must have been hectic and busy.</i>
280
<i>Thank you for going out of your way.</i>
281
<i>Huindol Village Bus Stop</i>
282
<i>Ba Bi.</i>
283
<i>I...</i>
284
<i>All this time,</i>
285
<i>I've been thinking a lot.</i>
286
<i>I think I know what you're going to say.</i>
287
<i>I had a feeling.</i>
288
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
289
<i>By the time you see this, you'll be in Singapore, right?</i>
290
<i>I hope only good things happen for you there, too.</i>
291
<i>I'll also sincerely be rooting for you.</i>
292
Oh?
293
What's this?
294
Yumi.
295
Oh.
296
I thought you got on the plane.
297
It was delayed. There was no announcement.
298
I think it happened so I can see you before I go.
299
Really?
300
I'm glad that I could see you and say goodbye in person before I left.
301
You saved me.
302
My entire manuscript was in here. Thank you.
303
When will you finish the book?
304
The end of the year? If it goes well, around Christmas.
305
Oh, I see.
306
Finish it well.
307
I want to, but I'm not skilled enough.
308
You'll do well.
309
What about a boyfriend?
310
Did you get a boyfriend?
311
- No. I don't have time to.
- Really?
312
<i>Whats this?</i>
313
<i>Why is he smiling? What does that mean?</i>
314
Ba Bi really
315
makes my heart flutter!
316
Hey, hey! Are you guys starting up again?
317
Is this the first or second time? Knock it off!
318
Ba Bi always speak sweetly.
319
We know, we know.
320
You?
321
- Me?
- Do you have a girlfriend?
322
I am seeing someone.
323
- What's this?
- Look at that. You heard him, right?
324
- Get a hold of yourself.
- I know. I said I know!
325
Did I say anything?
326
I see. I hope it goes well.
327
Team Leader Ba Bi.
328
We have to go in now.
329
Oh, really?
330
I'll head in.
331
Okay. Have a good trip.
332
Bye.
333
By the way, is that woman from earlier your girlfriend?
334
Oh, no.
335
For some reason, the mood seemed to be a bit...
336
She's my ex-girlfriend.
337
What about now?
338
It's been a while since we broke up.
339
Then why was she at the airport?
340
Things ended up that way coincidentally.
341
It was as if she was a girlfriend coming to see me off, right?
342
But, Team Leader. Why won't you go on any blind dates?
343
I've recommended several women, but you said you weren't going on any.
344
- Because I don't want to.
- Why?
345
Why are you smiling?
346
Why aren't you going on any?
347
I'm not sure.
348
I don't really know why, either.

<i>Episode 40
The Return</i>
350
<i>Love disappeared one year ago on Christmas Eve.</i>
351
â« <i>I didn't hear anything
The small light went out</i> â«
352
<i>Dating, damn you!</i>
353
<i>This damned love affair! I'm telling you it's exasperating!</i>
354
<i>Love changed into the incarnation of rage.</i>
355
<i>Love.</i>
356
<i>Give the prime cell position to Writer.</i>
357
â« <i>Ling Ling don't try to be understanding</i> â«
358
â« <i>Aside from minor quirks I am usually such a person</i> â«
359
<i>The day that she got kicked out of her position as prime cell,</i>
360
<i>Love was banished to another dimension.</i>
361
<i>Even when we met Wung as if it were fate,</i>
362
<i>and when we got back together with Ba Bi,</i>
363
<i>she didn't come back.</i>
364
<i>Yumi, should we...</i>
365
<i>get married?</i>
366
<i>Let's get married.</i>
367
<i>Even when she was proposed to...</i>
368
<i>All that time...</i>
369
<i>I've been thinking about it a lot...</i>
370
<i>I think I know what you're going to say.</i>
371
<i>Even when we were breaking up, Love didn't come back.</i>
372
- I'm better at that.
- Wait, why?
373
<i>Of course, it's not like there was never
a time when her heart fluttered after that.</i>
374
Writer Kim!
375
Ah, Oppa!
376
Mr. Yeon Il?
377
Oh, my friend said he wanted to greet you
before he left. Say hello, Yeon Il. This is Writer Yumi.
378
Hello.
379
Ah, hello.
380
I'm really enjoying My Love Muse.
381
Thank you.
382
- It's Love! Love is here!
- She said Love is here!
383
So she's finally back!
384
<i>She sometimes wonders, "Is this possibly a romantic feeling?" But...</i>
385
Me? I'm not Love, I'm Curiosity.
386
<i>There are a lot of cases where it's not.</i>
387
It's Curiosity. It's Curiousity!
388
What is it? Why are you acting like that?
389
- You guys were all fooled.
- So annoying.
390
<i>Romance</i>
391
Customer,
392
here is the book you were looking for.
393
- Yes.
<i>- Wow, he's handsome!</i>
394
It must be real this time!
395
Love has really come back!
396
Handsome men are not guilty.
397
Where's Love?
398
It's not her.
399
It's not her!
400
It was Sensitivity.
401
- What the heck?
- Man, I'm pissed off.
402
Excuse me.
403
I think you dropped this.
404
Ah. Thank you.
405
Really, really, my heart just dropped.
406
Is it real this time? This time it's love!
407
Guys, that guy, isn't he so sexy?
408
I want to touch his arms just once.
409
Clean him up.
410
<i>At first I could fool my feelings.</i>
411
<i>But these days Yumi can't be fooled.</i>
412
Eonni. You were piercing a hole with your eyes at Z's friends.
413
Are you falling in love?
414
It's not like that.
415
That's suspicious.
- I told you that's not what it is.
416
Okay.
417
<i>Will Love return this Christmas?</i>
418
No.
419
This Christmas, these guys returned.
420
<i>Fat</i>
421
Fat Cells.
422
We have finally arrived on a new land.
423
This is the land we will be living from now on.
424
Leader!
425
Then where do we settle down at?
426
Let's go to the heart!
427
Heart! Heart!
428
No, let's go to the love handles!
429
Huh?
430
- The love handles?
- The love handles are safe.
431
If we go there then there is lesser chances to get kicked out.
432
On top of that, a lot of our Fat siblings already live there.
433
- Yay!
- Let's go!
434
Let's go!
435
To the paradise of happiness, the love handles!
436
- To the love handles!
- The love handles!
437
- Yay!
- Woo!
438
No, not that way guys. Come here.
439
It's not?
440
Why can't I figure this out?
441
Yumi is now trying to meet her deadline before the end of her novel.
442
â« <i>I also wouldn't know</i> â«
443
â« <i>my heart</i> â«
444
I just have to write five chapters.
445
Just five chapters.
446
â« <i>There's a me</i> â«
447
Why does it have to be five chapters?
448
â« <i>I don't know</i> â«
449
â« <i>Even if I walk slowly</i> â«
450
â« <i>My heart is running far away there</i> â«
451
Why is it so messy?
452
Reason, how about we clean the room before we write?
453
Wait, are you crazy?!
454
Why are you trying to do things you
don't normally do during her deadline?
455
Reason, I suddenly want to find out
which resorts Hollywood celebs go to.
456
I really want to know where.
457
Let's try looking it up.
458
Curiosity, why are you acting like this too?
459
â« <i>my heart is far away there</i> â«
460
â« <i>Even at night when everyone is asleep</i> â«
461
â« <i>It's racing wide awake</i> â«
462
<i>When you get deadline syndrome,</i>
463
<i>everything except the deadline becomes interesting.</i>
464
Where is this?
465
â« <i>There is a world I don't know</i> â«
466
â« <i>Even if I spend a day when nothing happens</i> â«
467
These hairs.
468
â« <i>Even I still don't know</i> â«
469
â« <i>It's running there far away</i> â«
470
â« <i>It shouldn't run so fast</i> â«
471
â« <i>Even if I knew I can't do anything with my heart</i> â«
472
This is so fun!
473
Shall I wash the blankets in the village, too?
474
Stop it!
475
I'm going crazy.
476
Why are the last five chapters so hard?
477
I'm even sleepy.
478
Hello?
479
<i>Eonni, when are you done?</i>
480
I don't know. I don't have a plan.
481
I think I'm going to be cancelled.
482
<i>What do you mean, cancelled?</i>
483
<i>We all got a party together and are waiting for you!</i>
484
A party?
485
We're waiting to congratulate you for finishing your novel.
486
<i>First thing in the morning?</i>
487
We're going to start now. It's planned for the fifth.
488
Hurry up and come.
489
Miss Writer, the side dishes and beer
here are seriously killer! Hurry up and come!
490
Eonni Yi Da said she's coming right after her honeymoon trip, too.
491
Are you going to sit in the corner of
your room writing alone on Christmas Eve?
492
Eonni, do you really want to live like that?
493
No.
494
So get dressed and hurry up.
495
A party?
496
That sounds good.
497
What?
498
I just thought of something.
499
If I make the ending happen at a year-end party...
500
Eonni, I can't hear you very well.
501
Ah, that's right! That's it!
502
They meet each other for the first time there.
503
Coincidentally, at the year-end party.
504
They can't talk to each other at all because the music is so loud.
505
What? What are you talking about?
506
Okay, I'm hanging up!
507
That's right.
â« <i>Are you paying attention to me?</i> â«
508
They met there for the first time.
â« <i>Or is it meaningless?</i> â«
509
â« <i>Do our eyes keep meeting?</i> â«
510
â« <i>Or were you just looking at something behind me?</i> â«
511
That day was Christmas Eve.
512
Yeon Jae ends up going to the year-end party thrown by her company,
513
and ends up meeting him as if it's fated.
â« <i>I'm going to continue to hide it</i> â«
514
â« <i>so you won't know how I feel</i> â«
515
But because the music is too loud,
516
she can't hear him when he tells her his name.
517
But he remembered Yeon Jae's name.
518
Like a miracle.
519
<i>When her writer's block suddenly clears,</i>
520
<i>it's extremely thrilling.</i>
521
<i>It's none other than Endorphin Time.</i>
522
Yeah!!!
<i>Endorphin</i>
523
Everyone, we're here!
524
- Yay!
- Woo!
525
Everybody shout!
526
Who are we?
527
En-dor-phin!
528
- Yay!
- Woo!

It's done!!!
539
<i>It's been a year since she became a writer. During
that time, Yumi wrote two novels, My Love Muse</i>
540
<i>and it's sequel.</i>
541
It's so refreshing.
542
Kim Yumi, you worked hard.
543
<i>- Good job, Yumi.
- You worked hard, Yumi.</i>
544
<i>You worked hard, Yumi!</i>
545
<i>You worked hard, Yumi.</i>
546
<i>The cell village is also busy at the end of the year.</i>
547
<i>After the Endorphin concert, there's a year-end awards ceremony.</i>
548
It's a beautiful night.
549
<i>Yumi Awards</i>
550
<i>Yumi Awards</i>
551
All right, then. I'll announce this year's award winners.
552
End of the year closing.
553
The Most Improved Cell Award for Yumi's
cells that showed the most growth this year.
554
It can't be any other cell but me. Why are you acting
as if you don't know when you do? So embarrassing.
555
The Best Cell Award!
556
The winner is... The winner is...
557
Let's go to commercials.
558
Here?!
559
<i>My Love Muse 2! Currently a best-seller!</i>
560
<i>Yumi Awards
Best Cell Award</i>
561
<i>Sensitivity - Writer - Flowy</i>
562
The winner is...
563
Ba Bi's cells!
564
<i>Yumi Awards-The Best Cell Award
Babi's cells</i>
565
- Huh?
- What?
566
I can't believe this, seriously!
567
As Babi's cells are currently employed overseas,
568
they can't attend the award ceremony,
569
so I will accept in theirâ
- Hey!
570
I'm the one who made Yumi a writer!
571
And I made the first and second books a success!
572
You should be giving that award to me!
573
What kind of bulls**t is this!
574
Let me go!
575
Writer, calm down.
576
You are the one who wrote the books,
but Ba Bi was the one who saved you.
577
What? Ba Bi saved me?
578
<i>That's why I'm asking. Do you want to write for us?</i>
579
<i>I think you'll do a good job.</i>
580
The first one to recognize our talent was Ba Bi.
581
The one who always supported us was also Ba Bi.
582
â« <i>My dear,</i> â«
583
The one who even found our laptop in the end was Ba Bi, too.
584
<i>Writer Cell</i>
585
If Ba Bi hadn't believed in you, you
probably would have already been buried here.
586
<i>Do you admit it?</i>
587
<i>I admit it.</i>
588
â« <i>I will take it to you</i> â«
589
â« <i>and open your door</i> â«
590
<i>Thanks to you, I was able to finish the novel safely.</i>
591
<i>Thank you.</i>
592

<i>Notebook
Recipient: Kim Yumi</i>
597
Oh, right.
598
<i>Once she finished the book, there was something she had to do first.</i>
599
What is this?
600
<i>Laptop</i>
601
Hello.
602
Wung. Why did you send a laptop?
603
Oh! You saw?
604
I heard you lost yours. I thought you would need one right away.
605
<i>It's your equipment.</i>
606
No... Wung, I'm grateful...
607
But I found my laptop.
608
Oh, really? That's great.
609
So I will send this back.
610
That's okay. Just use it.
611
That's the newest model so it has the best specs.
612
No. Why would you buy me a laptop?
613
Why? I could give it as a gift.
614
So that you would write nice things.
615
No, this is really not right. I will send it back.
616
If you send it back then I will send you another one.
617
What?
618
And if you send it again then I will send one again and again.
619
Come on, what kind of stubbornness is that?
620
I have a call coming in.
621
Talk to you later.
622
Hello? Wung?
623
<i>So she went to return it personally.</i>
624
Hey, Yumi!
625
Aren't you Yumi?
626
Louis, it's been a long time.
627
Totally a long time.
628
What brings you here?
629
Come in.
630
I can wait in the lobby though.
631
What are you saying.
632
If ever I let you wait in the lobby
633
then Wung, that punk
634
no, I mean CEO Gu would kill me.
635
It's about time for the meeting to be
over so if you could just wait for a moment.
636
Yes.
637
Please be comfortable.
638
That... can I ask for your signature later?
639
Signature?
640
Yes. My girlfriend is a fan of your piece My Love Muse.
641
Yes.
642
Then I will bring you a paper later on.
643
- Please be comfortable.
- Yes.
644
How cool.
645
Gu Wung has really succeeded.
646
<i>CEO Gu WUng.</i>
647
<i>Wait. I think I have seen this name a lot.</i>
648
Storm Man. UlaUla.

<i>I keep on waiting for Monday!</i>
653
<i>The writer is so great! Hope she succeeds!</i>
654
<i>She keeps playing with her readers! Daebak!</i>
655
- Kim Yumi is the best!
- Julie Publishing, give the writer a big payment for the manuscript!
656
<i>My love muse is the best!</i>
657
<i>Writer Kim Yumi is the best!</i>
658
<i>That's right.</i>
659
<i>The nicknames that kept on posting praises every morning.</i>
660
<i>All this time, Wung was the one who posted those?</i>
661
â« <i>Even if I don't extend my hand the feeling of warmth</i> â«
662
He didn't even miss once, for a year.
663
How could this be? I got so much strength from all those comments.
664
This is really so Wung.
665
Gu Wung! Gu Wung! Gu Wung!
666
Gu Wung! Gu Wung! Gu Wung!
667
Gu Wung! Gu Wung!
668
I have an emergent suggestion.
669
Let's add one more cell award for this year.
670
As a co-Yumi award!
671
â« <i>Like a star</i> â«
672
â« <i>while looking at me smile brightly</i> â«

â« <i>You who are so precious to me</i> â«

â« <i>Always by my side</i> â«
676
â« <i>Remain by my side</i> â«
677
Yumi!
678
Sir!
679
Are you okay?
680
I'm okay.
681
Are you really okay?
682
I'm fine so you can go do your work.
683
Your slippers.
684
Thank you!
685
Are you really okay?
- I am totally fine.
686
Even if you have become the CEO, you haven't changed.
687
But what brings you here? I was so surprised to hear you came.
688
I came to bring the laptop.
689
I told you I won't take it back.
690
I also earn money well these days.
691
Also, I'm very thankful
692
so I can't accept this. I also have a conscience.
693
What are you so thankful for?
694
There's this thing.
695
I am really moved, Wung.
696
Let's eat lunch together. I will be done in thirty minutes.
697
I need to go.
698
Where?
- I just dropped by because it was on my way.
699
I will get going.
700
Can't I go too?
701
It's a gathering for the publisher.
702
I know Control Z too.
703
Later. Let's eat together.
704
It's my treat.
705
Why?
- Because I'm thankful.
706
Merry Christmas, Wung.
707
Merry Christmas.

not mean the end to a connection to someone.</i>

What?
716
â« <i>I only wanna be with you everyday</i> â«
717

Hi, guys.

Love!
775
When did you come back?
776
A few days ago.
777
A few days ago?
778
I don't exactly know whether it was a few days or today?
779
<i>Because I was suddenly sucked in.</i>
780
<i>Where am I?</i>
781
When I opened my eyes, I was back.
782
I'm late because I had to walk back from the desert.
783
I couldn't fly because I'm not the prime cell.
784
Anyway, it's good to see you, even though I don't know how you got back.

I missed you.
