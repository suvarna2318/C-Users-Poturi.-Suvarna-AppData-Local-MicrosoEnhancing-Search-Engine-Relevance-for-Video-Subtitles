If you're going to throw it away,
then don't give birth.
3
Please take care of her.
4
Anything?
5
She probably ran away.
6
I guess so.
7
Give me the towel.
8
Woosung, I'm sorry.
9
I'll be sure to come pick you up.
10
Here we go again.
I'll come pick him up.
11
No number...
12
They have no intention of doing that.
13
Hey, hurry up and delete the video.
14
Your eyes are bright too, huh?
15
Just not much hair on the eyebrows.
16
Even so, you're such a cute kid.
17
How could they think of
getting rid of you? Really, huh?
18
So, you're Woosung.
19
That's right, Woosung.
20
You can be happy with us now. OK?
21
Right?
22
<i>For those wanting to transfer
to a bus or an express bus,</i>
23
<i>please exit now.</i>
24
<i>The exit for the Busan
West Intercity Bus Terminal,</i>
25
<i>is exit 3.</i>
26
<i>Gimhae International Airport is...</i>
27
- How's your knee?
- Huh?
28
- Your knees hurt, right?
- Yes, I'm okay.
29
- You okay?
- Oh, it's gotten a lot better.
30
Okay.
31
You should come more often.
32
It'll be good for you
to exercise.
33
It's been a while, so I just want
to rest whenever I come here.
34
Is the laundry doing well these days?
35
It's so-so...
36
<i>Hey Socrates...</i>
37
By the way,
38
I can't believe
they're thinking of
39
using baby boxes
for human trafficking.
40
That's really bold.
41
It's their fault for making
those boxes in the first place
42
it's creating irresponsible mothers...
43
You have a nice side to you.
44
Why?
45
Oh, that baby.
46
He would've died
if he had been left on that floor.
47
I am nice.
48
You didn't know?
49
Was it a boy or a girl?
50
- Hello.
- How have you been?
51
You worked hard.
52
That dish last time was really good
53
It was Shu, Shu...
54
- Schweinshaxen.
- Oh, Schweinshaxen.
55
The day after
56
I was so surprised
because my skin was so smooth.
57
What are you saying?
It's just pig's feet.
58
And, uh,
do you happen to know Choucroute?
59
I'm gonna try making that next.
60
You should come to have a bite.
61
It's just boiled pork. It's bland.
62
I left the white one at the laundry.
63
I brought it in black instead.
64
- It's thick.
- Oh, thanks.
65
- And this too, just in case...
- Right, thanks.
66
- Go, okay, go.
- Okay.
67
- Take care.
- Yeah, okay.
68
Whatever the situation is,
69
you should get out of the car
and say goodbye...
70
It's fine.
71
He stays home all day anyways.
72
It's good for him
to get some exercise.
73
He's a perfect match
for a marriage partner.
74
Oh, really?
75
What about it? Do you want him?
76
Because even if you have a kid,
77
he can look after the kid
since he writes from home...
78
The baby's mother came to see him?
79
Is something wrong?
80
Yes.
81
They left the baby
outside. Outside the box.
82
Could it have been a mistake?
Because she was flustered?
83
Hey, if you think they're gonna go to
the police just bring the baby here, OK?
84
I'll do that.
85
Okay.
86
There's nothing on the records...
87
Call the pastor.
88
And can you please give Soo-kyung
a bath for me?
89
OK, sure.
90
You were on night
watch yesterday, right?
91
Yes, every Sunday...
92
Can you show her
some of the babies you have now?
93
This is a playroom for big kids.
94
There are 19 kids living here.
95
They're all abandoned in the baby box.
96
He came in last week...
97
The mother was 15 years old...
98
His mom is from Pakistan.
99
She said she was a babysitter.
100
That's it?
101
Yes, for now.
102
What about letters?
Did you put a letter with the baby?
103
Yes.
104
How about your name and contact number?
Did you write that, too?
105
So even if you have a baby,
106
there's no evidence
that you're the mother...
107
What's going on?
108
She's looking for a baby named Woosung.
109
She says she left a baby
outside the baby box yesterday.
110
If you had put the baby in the box,
our staff would have gone out
111
right away and spoken to you.
112
Yes.
113
- That's what I said.
- Peek-a-boo.
114
Peek-a-boo!
115
Of course, not.
116
Kidnapping?
117
What are you talking about?
118
Hey, don't you think so?
119
You threw him away.
120
What are you talking about?
I just left him with you for a bit.
121
Do you think we're like a dog hotel?
122
I even wrote in the letter
that I'd come and pick him up.
123
If there's a message saying
124
you're coming back for the baby,
125
the church takes
the baby off the adoption list.
126
He's 100% going to a childcare facility.
127
Do you know what that means?
128
Well, I'm sure you did it out of love,
129
but that's what narrows down
this kid's future possibilities.
130
We...
131
uh, Woosung...
132
we want to save Woosung
from that dark future.
133
It's better for him
to grow up in a nice home
134
than to be an orphan
in a childcare facility...
135
It's much better.
136
Adoption.
137
We're looking for parents to raise him.
138
You don't have the right to do that.
139
You don't have the right either,
you abandoned him.
140
- You stole him.
- To protect.
141
Yes, of course.
We don't have the right. We don't.
142
In other words...
143
Should I say it's with good intentions?
144
Good intentions...
145
I haven't heard those words in a while.
146
There are people wanting children
but can't have them
147
and can't wait
for the screening period,
148
we can send the baby to those parents.
149
You're in an explainable situation.
150
Your name is...
151
It's Seon-ah, Moon Seon-ah.
152
Miss Seon-ah.
153
You can think of us as a cupid
154
that sends your precious baby
to those parents.
155
I promise to find
the best adoptive parents for Woosung.
156
Cupid my ass.
157
Yeah, well,
it's a bit strange to call us that...
158
What's another good name...
159
Should we call ourselves the storks?
Since it's two of us, two storks?
160
Oh, and...
161
It's case by case,
but there's a little reward.
162
A reward?
163
How much was it?
164
It's about 10 million won for a boy.
165
For who?
166
Of course,
for you and us, the mediators...
167
Good intentions my ass.
168
You're just a broker.
169
To put it simply, yes.
170
When is the departure?
171
- Get some rest.
- Yes, go home.
172
Yes.
173
She's the mother of that baby, right?
174
I'm not sure.
175
She doesn't look like it...
176
Oh, Taeho.
177
What are doing h...
178
Oh, hello.
179
We're temporarily closed for today..
180
I don't know if this can be removed...
181
Oh, this...
182
This is...
183
It's obviously blood.
184
I'll give it a try.
185
And, the
186
the money could be here by next week...
187
We're going to open
a chicken restaurant here.
188
Well, if you can't,
I'll take you to the casino.
189
No. I'm not going back.
190
I guess he has another solution.
191
Then you'll have 5,000 by next week
192
and please take care of that shirt.
193
Okay.
194
Goodbye.
195
Hey, Taeho.
196
Since when have you been hanging out
with thugs like that?
197
Why are you nagging me?
198
Mind your own business, old man.
199
You were doing a good
at the restaurant with your mom.
200
Those noodles
make me sick to my stomach now.
201
What was that?
202
Nothing. They came to complain.
203
And fix this.
204
There's a trick to it.
Press it to the left.
205
Do we have to take her?
206
Well, it's good to have his mother
around, it'll be less suspicious.
207
Ms. Sun-ah, let's go, let's go.
208
It's like she's crazy for money.
209
- 50-50?
- That's right.
210
At least divide it into three...
211
If we take the Gyeongbu
Expressway to Yeongdeok,
212
it will take us 2
hours and 30 minutes.
213
We'll take a break at the rest stop
in Gyeongju around lunch time.
214
They wouldn't go too far
with a car like that, right?
215
Maybe Ulsan or Pohang?
216
I wanna take a shower
and change as soon as possible.
217
You know, right?
218
We're gonna catch them red-handed.
219
Ms. Sun-ah, where are you from?
220
I'm from Busan.
221
He's self-proclaimed from Seoul.
222
Self-proclaimed?
223
Where are you from then?
224
Yeosu.
225
Yeosu?
226
There's nothing
but gondolas there, isn't it?
227
Cable car.
228
The sashimi is good there.
229
The leaf mustard kimchi is good too...
What that?
230
Remember when we went to sell a kid.
231
And it was a male couple?
232
Oh, yeah, that's right, that's right.
233
That was in Yeosu.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
234
I wonder how he grew up?
He must be in elementary school by now.
235
Night beach at Yeosu.
236
Stop talking nonsense.
Leave the negotiations to us.
237
Yeah, the customer always comes first.
238
Think of them as
people who chose to buy...
239
Hey, hey...
240
- What?
- They're coming.
241
Are you Mr. Lim Chang Ho?
242
I'm the guy from Busan...
243
- Yes, show us the baby.
- Yes, of course.
244
He just woke up from a nap...
245
Beautiful, isn't he?
246
By any chance,
did you use Photoshop on his pictures?
247
This one is not as
cute as the picture...
248
It's only because he just woke up.
249
No, you can see that even his eyebrows.
250
It's too thin...
251
That's because he's a baby. His
eyes usually look like this, like this.
252
He's a beautiful baby.
Woosung, open your eyes.
253
Open your eyes, go on.
254
Let's make it 400.
255
But you said a thousand yesterday.
256
Even 400 is too much in this situation.
257
Right.
258
Or we can pay in installments.
Installments are OK, right?
259
- 12-month installment.
- Yeah, that's good.
260
Well, this is something
I've never heard of before.
261
You can't suddenly
put up such conditions.
262
What can you tell us about his father?
263
The father?
264
The father, well...
265
Hey, don't tell me
266
It's not rape
or something like that, is it?
267
- We can't be...
- What are you talking about?
268
- Involved in something like that...
- No,
269
No, the baby's mother right here
and she's a very diligent person.
270
She's been all alone taking care
of her sick parents...
271
Hey, you crazy punk.
272
What, what, crazy?
273
Talking about no eyebrows and
small eyes, have you seen your face?
274
What the fuck are you talking about?
275
- Are you crazy?
- What, you bastard!
276
Ms. Sun-ah, Ms. Sun-ah. Okay.
277
What is this person doing? So rude...
278
Rude?
279
Yeah, I'm damn rude.
Are you polite? Huh?
280
When you look at other people's babies
and talk nonsense. Are you being polite?
281
I came all the way to
this crappy village and now what? 400?
282
Is this a fucking joke Fuck that.
283
I would never give
him to people like you.
284
Get the fuck out of here before I do
something I regret, you beggar bastard.
285
What, beggars, really...
286
Wait...
287
Beggars...
288
Seriously...
289
Wanna get some crabs?
Everything is steamed in stores.
290
That was harsh.
291
Yeah, yeah, it was harsh.
292
That's what I should be saying.
293
He was a customer.
294
We haggle with each other...
295
That's a customer.
296
If he wasn't a customer,
I would've beaten the shit out of him.
297
That's how we negotiate...
298
Well, with that attitude...
things won't go your...
299
If you want to make it work,
find a better buyer.
300
That makes sense.
301
What? 12-month installment plan
for 4 million won? Is this a joke?
302
What should we do?
303
Shall we go back to Busan?
304
We have no other choice.
305
There are other candidates, right?
306
- Hello, sir.
- Hey.
307
Is there any blood?
308
A little bit - Candy?
309
Oh, thank you.
310
Tomorrow is Children's Day.
311
Yes, my grandmother gave me
allowance when I left for work.
312
What about identification?
313
We're contacting his family now.
314
What's the cause of death?
315
I think he broke his neck
because he got beaten up.
316
He's still young.
317
I really hate blood.
318
This view is amazing.
319
Hmm.
320
A girl?
321
There will be more, right?
322
They can't just go back to Busan...
323
They can't do that.
324
Hi.
325
That person over there has been
the director for three generations.
326
He looks like
he's been working for 3 years, huh?
327
- Brother Dong-soo!
- Brother Dong-soo!
328
- How have you been?
- Brother Dong-soo!
329
- Hi, how are you?
- Hello.
330
- Bro, I'll show you this!
- It's brother Dong-soo!
331
- Hey, it's brother Dong-soo.
- Brother Dong-soo? Dong-soo?
332
- Wow, it's Dong-soo!
- It's Dong-soo!
333
It's brother Dong-soo.
334
Wow, it's brother Dong-soo!
335
Really? For real?
336
So that's why he wanted to come here.
337
You should've called
to tell me you were coming.
338
It looks like few are gone.
339
Three kids, in about 6 months?
340
Hey, I lose 450 a month
341
on subsidies
Hey, you guys go play now.
342
- Go play.
- Let's go.
343
Hey, the losing team
gets a finger flick, okay?
344
Hurry up and go.
345
What?
346
He got a new wife.
347
Hey, she's too young.
348
Oh? How did they meet?
349
A dating app?
Or something like that?
350
Hey, you! Hey!
351
Hey, you idiot,
I told you not to go in there. Hey!
352
Can't you see that flower?
353
How many times do I
have to tell you?
354
Dong-soo! Let's play basketball.
355
- Okay.
- Come on.
356
Nice, nice.
357
Remember how you told the chief that
358
they're selling infants
and the church was in on it?
359
The church is in on it.
360
That young man is
also a church employee.
361
I thought he was a part-timer?
362
He's an employee,
just not a full employee.
363
But for a professional broker,
364
they look like they're
doing a sloppy job...
365
You added lukewarm water to this, right?
366
It's because you didn't wait
for three minutes.
367
Aren't you a professional broker
if you sell and get paid?
368
That's right but...
369
I feel like saying that they're behind
an organization is going too far.
370
You don't like the detective department
talking shit to us, do you?
371
Give it to me.
372
Give me the ball.
373
No, no!
374
- That's not a goal! That's not a goal!
- Yoon-woo.
375
Yeah?
376
Let Ha-jun borrow it now.
377
Haejin, that's enough football.
378
Five more minutes please!
379
He's not improving much, that kid.
380
I see that the scar is still there.
381
You bled so much when that happened.
382
I called the ambulance and everything
It was crazy.
383
There was a kite on the branch,
384
I was going to grab it
when it broke...
385
Young-min is the only
troublemaker like that now.
386
Young-min?
387
Oh, Young-min?
388
He's escaping now.
389
Again?
390
At least, that hasn't changed.
391
I haven't heard from him.
392
Sorry to say...
393
That's not why I visit anymore.
394
Well, at first
it's like a blind date.
395
Toe.
396
Okay, I'll take a picture
and send it to you. Okay.
397
His eyebrows are a bit thin, huh?
398
Excuse me for a second.
399
- That's weird.
- Huh?
400
What? He looks strong with this.
401
But why am I playing the wife?
402
- Everyone here knows Dong-soo.
- Oh, it's a baby.
403
Then you can tell
them I'm your daughter.
404
<i>So cute.</i>
405
We don't look alike at all.
406
Hey kid, don't touch him.
407
Your hands are dirty from the ball.
408
I said don't touch him.
409
And we're doing this
until someone comes to buy him.
410
What's the big deal?
Hey, don't touch him,
411
your hands are dirty from the ball.
412
He has weird eyebrows.
413
Can I be your son?
414
Why?
415
I want to play football.
416
Football?
417
I want to make a lot
of money like Son Heung-min.
418
Well, it hasn't been long
since Woosung was born...
419
And it's too early to talk
about a second kid, right?
420
Right, one's enough.
421
It would be a good suggestion.
422
There was a kid from here
who became a professional footballer.
423
He wore... what was it,
424
the team with stripes on their uniforms?
425
No idea.
426
Well, these facilities
they promote saying
427
even people like us can succeed but
428
97% - Stop being a smart ass.
429
3% is great, too.
430
Look at him getting riled up
about this place.
431
What percent
of the average is successful then...
432
Who is it?
433
They said he escaped.
Must've been caught and brought back.
434
I broke Dong-soo's record!
435
It took them 3 days to catch me.
436
That's nothing to brag about.
437
Considering time and distance,
I was much ahead.
438
You must be real proud.
439
Yes, hello?
440
<i>Okay, I understand.
You're in Uljin, right?</i>
441
<i>- No, no. That's alright.</i>
- What the hell?
442
<i>- We'll see you tomorrow.</i>
- What's up with your eyebrows?
443
Here is your order seafood doenjang.
444
The coin laundromat...
445
This is Si-woo, he
was a grade below me.
446
- I was the forward.
- Buttons.
447
- And he was the midfielder.
- Do they attach the buttons?
448
Back then, we would've made
two football teams.
449
- Don't you think so?
- Well now,
450
- When I go as a coach...
- I take the seams out
451
from pants they shortened
452
- 11 players...
- The worn out knees.
453
- They don't put a lining, right?
- No, there's no one.
454
You know that law, adoption...
455
Yeah, the adoption law.
456
The conditions for
overseas adoptions
457
became more strict
so I thought it was good.
458
But don't all the kids
want to be adopted?
459
Oh, well...
460
That kid that likes football,
he seems very active.
461
Yes, Haejin.
462
It's already too late for him.
463
He's 7 years old.
464
He's 8.
465
Oh, too late. Too late.
466
Too late for him.
467
Adoption... you can say
that's only for kids
468
below 6...
469
Even he should know by now...
470
There are also kids that come
because they don't want it.
471
There was a case like
that recently, remember?
472
The adopted child was abused.
473
It's because blood
is thicker than water.
474
Think about what would've happened
475
if the parents had a biological baby
after the adoption.
476
Yeah, that's for most of the kids here
at least once, right?
477
They were denied of their existence
when they were abandoned, right?
478
And they experience it again.
479
Then, I've been denied all my life.
480
What?
481
Then do something about that whistle.
482
You're not the military.
483
Hey - The whistle.
484
For me, it's like
485
me wanting to be like a father to them.
486
Understand?
487
So that's why I'm using this whistle
like this, OK?
488
Hey, hurry up and hide.
489
Good night, my baby.
490
In the front garden and back garden,
491
birds and baby sheep,
492
they're all asleep.
493
She was singing.
494
What song?
495
A lullaby.
496
A lullaby?
497
It's so nice here because
they have everything you need.
498
Let's take it all.
499
Rub his earlobes like this.
500
You talk too much...
501
Well, if we search a little more,
502
we could find a someone
with better conditions.
503
Just go with the ones in Uljin.
504
All done.
505
You were so good during your bath.
506
Your mom wants to say goodbye to you
as soon as possible.
507
We're working so hard...
508
Do you know how hard
it is to raise a child by yourself?
509
That's still not a reason to
510
abandon your child.
511
How are you going
to justify selling them?
512
There are people
selling them because
513
there are people
abandoning them.
514
That's the right order.
515
Then you shouldn't have made that box.
516
That's what I'm saying.
517
It's only there to make the mothers
feel at ease
518
by telling them we're saving
the baby or whatever.
519
That's not the case.
Woosung is alive
520
because of that box.
521
That wipe has alcohol in it
you can't wipe his face with that.
522
Look at him crying.
523
Sorry, I'm sorry.
524
Then how many mothers
do you think come back for them
525
after leaving only a letter behind?
526
How would I know?
527
It's one out of forty.
528
You never hear from
the other 39 ever again.
529
Why are you only complaining about the
mothers? Say the same about the dads.
530
You could've at least left
your contacts in the letter.
531
This is the second time hearing that.
532
What? You want me to tell you again?
533
I can tell you many times as you want.
534
Who are you to be so arrogant?
535
Do you think you're
something because
536
the kids call you big brother
537
at this pathetic place?
538
You feel proud?
Then just stay here.
539
Oh, it's cold.
540
He thought
541
his mother would be one in forty.
542
Well, you see that old door there
543
outside at the playground? Over there.
544
They said he was abandoned there
545
with a letter saying,
"I'll be back to get you."
546
That's the reason why he's so grumpy
so please cut him some slack.
547
Jiyoung was working.
548
Yeah, she came back.
549
Becoming a singer was
never gonna happen.
550
I liked her voice though.
551
3 to 1.
552
Well
553
we all settle down here.
554
But it looks fun.
555
- Yeah?
- 4 to 1.
556
Fun?
557
It's more fun than
being alone I suppose.
558
Still.
559
You should go far away, far.
560
Far away, where?
561
Far.
562
You're the hope
and the star for us kids.
563
Where am I supposed to go?
564
Anywhere.
565
I think it'll be sad
if you do come back, really.
566
Good morning.
567
Woosung, it's raining.
568
It's raining.
569
This is a raindrop.
570
It's the same thing.
571
I'm sorry about yesterday.
572
I was too harsh.
573
I don't remember.
574
I have these dreams sometimes
575
it's raining...
576
And the rain washes me clean
from everything of my past.
577
But when I open my eyes,
578
it's still pouring.
579
And nothing has changed.
580
Wouldn't it be okay
if you had an umbrella?
581
An umbrella?
582
Yes, a big umbrella.
583
Something that two people can use...
584
Stop it.
585
I hope it's red
One with strawberries on it.
586
When I was young,
my friend had something like that.
587
I was so jealous.
588
You stole it?
589
Yeah, I took it and threw it away.
590
But they're not blood related, are they?
591
Yeah, everyone calls her mom, but...
592
Everyone?
593
It woke me up
and my husband, too.
594
We were so shocked
that we couldn't sleep.
595
What's happening?
596
No, a police car came to them.
597
- What's happened? Huh?
- Quiet, quiet.
598
- Hey, come here.
- Hold on a second.
599
No, that...
600
I've never seen him before.
What's going on?
601
He was killed in a hotel, then...
602
Take a good look.
603
It's a picture captured by the hotel
CCTV. The girl lives here, right?
604
Yeji.
605
Take the kids over there.
606
Really, in front of the kids..
607
Hang on. Hey tall kid.
608
Tall kid, wait a minute.
609
Here, candy.
610
You can tell me anything.
611
She lives here, right?
612
I don't know.
613
Ma'am,
614
This kid here is a baby, isn't he?
615
I told her not to give birth.
How can a girl become a mother?
616
What? What did you say?
617
I said I told her not to give birth!
618
How can a girl like
that become a mother?
619
Quiet! Quiet!
620
Then is this... what you do here.
621
Is this mother-like?
622
Well, I
623
just took care of the kids
who didn't have a place to go.
624
Murder?
625
You mean prostitution?
626
So you're saying
627
that she needed to run,
but the baby got in her way.
628
Give me three days. I'm going to
make sure they sell within that time.
629
If it's murder,
the detective department will move?
630
They're already on the move.
631
We should set them up.
632
A set-up?
633
As a buyer.
634
- The person you're calling...
- Shit...
635
She's not picking up,
the one from Uljin.
636
This is all because you sent her
the picture with weird eyebrows.
637
What do you think of this?
638
20 million won.
639
Twice the market price...
640
Do you want to meet them?
641
Huh? Who?
642
I think it's the owner of the building.
643
How old is the woman?
644
36.
645
- Why?
- You want someone younger?
646
No, it's not that.
647
I have a bad feeling about this though.
648
Isn't this too cheap?
649
10 million?
650
The market price for the baby.
651
A girl baby only costs 8 million won.
652
Miss - Yeah?
653
Using bait to provoke crime...
654
Two million won.
655
- Isn't that against the law?
- What's the difference?
656
This is pissing me off.
657
What did you say?
658
I've learned that it's not even taken
as evidence in a trial.
659
They had intentions
to commit the crime from the start.
660
This isn't crime induction.
661
It's giving them an opportunity.
662
Opportunity...
663
<i>Oh, Bro Socrates...</i>
664
Hey, if we get a deal there, you know...
665
Do you want to go to that place
when we get back to Busan?
666
Are you asking to go see Jennifer?
667
No, you can go on your own.
668
- I'm not interested in those places.
- Keep it down, you punk...
669
You're good at
talking nonsense even in this situation.
670
Just to relax the situation.
671
Even in the military,
before the soldiers go to training.
672
You didn't even go to the military
because you were in jail.
673
You didn't go either.
674
You exempted for
being from an orphanage.
675
I'm on the same level
as gold medalists.
676
Why is love like this again?
677
What's wrong?
678
Why would you pull over here?
679
I think I'm gonna pee.
680
I'm really going to pee.
681
This kid...
682
I told you.
I have a bad feeling about this.
683
That hunch was this?
684
Car was shaking so much
that I almost peed a little bit.
685
This car stinks.
686
Look at this kid talking like this
No one told you to get in the car.
687
Sir, can you take me with you?
688
No, everyone will be worried.
689
I'll give you some money,
you take the bus home by yourself.
690
No.
691
Why are you trying to
interrupt our family trip?
692
I already know.
You're not a family.
693
You're trying to sell Woosung.
694
- How much did you hear?
- Everything.
695
Please be careful.
I'll put this here.
696
The important thing
is to not say negative things like,
697
"The baby doesn't have thick hair",
or, "His eyes are too small."
698
And don't ask the mother
about the baby's biological father.
699
- There must be something going on.
- Okay,
700
- Have some coffee.
- Yes, thank you.
701
Yes, thank you.
702
Do they look like building owners?
703
Aren't you a bit young?
704
I'm sorry.
705
No, you don't need to apologize.
706
Oh, okay.
707
So, you two are married
708
but not officially registered.
709
That's why official adoption
is not an option for you.
710
- Okay.
- Yes.
711
And let's say your
sperm count is a bit low.
712
Me?
713
Just give them the money
quickly and do it naturally.
714
Got it. Your sperm count
is low and speak naturally...
715
Not enough sperm count
and money quickly...
716
Then, let's practice our line.
717
Yes, okay.
718
And this is the money we've prepared.
719
It's already been 5 years since
we started the infertility treatment.
720
And we're exhausted from waiting.
721
Hey detective, how about we mention
the de facto marriage story here?
722
Since our marriage is not legal,
723
legal adoption is not easy,
something like that...
724
Okay, let's go with that.
725
Thank you.
726
We will cherish him
like our actual child.
727
Should we take out
the "actual" from that sentence?
728
Should I take out "actual"?
729
Oh, okay, minus the "actual", right.
730
Let's really cherish our children
No...
731
We will cherish our children...
732
- What did I say?
- Cherish.
733
Oh, right.
734
We will cherish
735
the baby
736
like our very own.
737
<i>Jin jin ja ra, Ji ri ji ri ja.
Jin jin ja ra, Ji ri ji ri ja.</i>
738
Jin jin ja ra, Ji ri ji ri ja.
739
Oh, can I call this car Hae Jin-ho?
740
Yeah, suit yourself.
741
Yes!
742
But Jennifer? Who's Jennifer?
743
That's Dong-soo's girlfriend.
744
Hey, what does it say here?
745
- Oh, this?
- Yes.
746
Hae-jin.
747
It's my name.
The pastor gave it to me.
748
You must really like your name.
749
No.
750
This is the only way to not get it
stolen at the orphanage.
751
Thieves steal everything
even if you write your name on it.
752
- <i>9388, pull over to the right.</i>
- Right?
753
<i>9388, pull over to the right.</i>
754
What? I didn't even speed up.
755
Damn, huh?
756
You're the wife...
757
So, let's say that you are
our store employees and are a couple.
758
No, we don't have to be a couple.
759
I don't like it either.
760
Then let's call you a relative.
A distant relative.
761
- Got it?
- What? Second cousin? Eighth?
762
- That's not...
- Hello.
763
Good day, sir.
764
Your license please.
765
Sure.
766
But I wasn't speeding...
767
Mr. Ha Jin-young.
768
Your trunk door is open.
769
You'll cause a huge accident
if things were too fall out
770
I'm sorry.
771
Are you all going somewhere?
772
Yes.
773
We're going to Lotte World
to ride the Ferris wheel.
774
Wow, you're going far, aren't you?
775
Yes, we're going on a family trip.
776
But there's no Ferris wheel there.
777
Really?
778
If you want to ride a Ferris wheel,
779
you have to go to Wolmido.
780
Shall we go to Wolmido then?
781
If you have time, - Yes.
782
Ask your dad for a ride
on the cruise ship.
783
- Yeah!
- I'm a little weak on boats.
784
I get motion sickness...
785
- Do you run a laundry?
- Yes.
786
I recently got this shirt
back from a dry cleaners.
787
It got all shriveled up.
What's wrong with this?
788
This needs to be dry cleaned
but it looks like they just washed it.
789
Oh, really?
790
There are so many amateurs
in dry cleaning these days.
791
- Boss...
- You have to pay attention.
792
- Make sure to clean this...
- Boss!
793
- What?
- I think we should go...
794
- Yeah, we have to...
- Your license, yes.
795
Yes, thank you.
796
You have to dry clean it next time.
797
- All right.
- Okay.
798
- Have a good time.
- Yes.
799
- To Wolmido.
- Okay.
800
- Oh, my. Hello.
- Oh, yes.
801
I'm sorry I'm late.
Did you wait long?
802
- Not at all.
- No.
803
We just got here.
804
- I see.
- Yes.
805
I'm Ha Sang-hyun.
Are you Song Ji-chul?
806
Yes, that's correct.
807
- Is he Woosung?
- Yes, yes.
808
- Are you his mother?
- Yes.
809
Could I please hold the baby?
810
Yes, go ahead.
811
I touched him.
I'm touching him, honey.
812
His facial features are so clear now.
813
- Yes.
- Yes.
814
You're really
going to raise him properly, right?
815
Of course, we will really cherish him.
816
Are you going to cherish him the
same way even if your own child is born?
817
Of course.
818
- You're serious?
- That's enough.
819
- I should pay, huh?
- Yeah, this is really happening.
820
Give them the money...
821
- Even his eyebrows are now...
- And your infertility treatment?
822
We've already been
doing it for 5 years, soâ¦
823
- Both of us.
- Both of us have gotten tired of it.
824
- Right.
- So that's why weâ¦
825
We're not officially married, so...
826
Honey.
827
Have you tested for AMH?
828
Or HSG?
829
- Yeah, well, that one...
- Yes.
830
I guess Letrozole didn't work.
831
Yes. Letrozole had such
serious side effects, so I...
832
It's so hard for her to watch me like
that, so I intend to stop taking it now.
833
Letrozole is an
ovulation-inducing product.
834
Of course it won't
work if you take that.
835
I know, right? So, my sperm...
836
We're talking about
ovulation-inducing drugs.
837
Why are you bringing up sperm?
838
Here, here.
Take this, take this.
839
That's just for resale, right?
840
I recognized it right away.
841
Do you know about
reselling medication?
842
Haejin, don't open that window.
843
- Someone paid them to do it.
- Don't touch me.
844
But how do you know
so much about infertility treatment?
845
Wow, there's a lot of foam.
846
No, something similar
happened last year, hyung was scammed.
847
I said don't touch me.
I'm just, just looking.
848
If we had given up on him,
849
Woosung would have gone
to another country by now...
850
Hey!
851
Hey, hey, close it, close it, you punk!
852
Close it, you punk!
Hey, hey, close it. Hurry up!
853
He's going to catch a cold.
854
Let's take care of what's in the back.
855
Stop it.
856
But that driver's
license I saw earlier...
857
Yeah?
858
Who's Ha Jin-young?
859
Sanghyun is my nickname
From when I was in the military.
860
Right so, hyung, you know you didn't go
to the military, don't you? Right?
861
Figure it out, punk.
862
What about you?
863
"I have a weak stomach,
so I get motion sickness"?
864
Wasn't that entirely real?
865
What do you mean it was real?
It was completely ridiculous.
866
Haejin was better.
867
Idiot.
868
Actually, the name Sang-hyun...
869
I was going to give it to
my son when he was born.
870
Really?
871
Yeah.
872
It's not really a funny
story or anything, huh?
873
So-young...
874
Huh?
875
My real name is Moon So-young.
876
Then Sun-ah is...
877
Just a really annoying
lady who lives next door.
878
What a bunch of liars, am I right?
879
I mean, since this happened...
880
Should we use it?
881
A person's death.
882
Hello.
883
Who's this?
884
Hand over the baby.
885
You paid all the money to that mother.
886
5 million won.
887
You were supposed to erase
that baby on that condition.
888
Why did you give birth to that baby?
889
Moon So-young, we're the police.
890
Can I talk with you for a moment?
891
You're here?
892
You're here?
893
Took you a while.
894
We're making a three-person work
responsibility schedule.
895
A work responsibility schedule?
896
A schedule for feeding milk to Woosung.
897
Did something good happen?
898
Yes.
899
I have a guest in Seoul.
900
They're giving me 30 million won.
901
Oh, that's amazing.
902
Are you going to give him a bath now?
903
Oh, no.
904
He has poop on his butt,
and this hyung is really bad at this.
905
Okay, two-hour shifts from 10 p.m.
906
until 6 a.m., how about that?
907
"Sang, Dong, So, Dong, Sang..."
908
Wait, this is a schedule where
you sleep well for 6 hours, ya know.
909
No, rather than sleeping wellâ¦
can't I do this?
910
- That's a bit too much.
- Oh, really?
911
- I want to do it.
- What?
912
- Feeding him powdered milk.
- Really?
913
- Then from 4am to 6am?
- Yes.
914
Then, from 10pm to 12pm.
915
You can't take your
shift out and give it away.
916
Don't you think she seems
easy to cooperate with?
917
You're right.
918
Did the commutation
of the sentence reduction work?
919
No, I don't think so.
920
- <i>Give it to me.</i>
- Then what?
921
<i>Hey, then...</i>
922
I don't know, well, I...
923
I don't know, but...
924
<i>Just do it all.</i>
925
I don't think it's a commutation.
926
<i>I want to take a bath, too.</i>
927
You wash yourself.
928
Geez, I don't want to.
929
How is he? Did you feed him?
930
No, he threw up again.
931
Are you sure you cooled it down?
Isn't it because it's too hot?
932
It was fine.
933
Is it because he got wet yesterday?
934
I'm sorry, Woosung.
935
No, it's not your fault.
936
No, I don't think it's just a cold...
937
Have you ever done it before?
938
We have to take him
to the hospital, hyung.
939
We can't do that.
We might get caught.
940
It's not like meningitis, right?
941
Since yesterday,
his fever suddenly went up...
942
Will he get better?
943
What if he dies?
944
Is he your little brother?
945
Yes.
946
He'll be fine. He won't die.
947
It looks like a cold,
948
but make sure that you
keep an eye on him
949
so that it doesn't
spread into pneumonia.
950
For now, I'll give you a fever reducer.
951
If his fever doesn't go down,
come back tomorrow.
952
Woosung, that's great.
953
What's sadder than love
954
is affection.
955
Will the baby be okay?
956
Everyone's making a fuss...
957
Anyway, It's just a cold.
958
Well, that's true, but...
959
But it'll be a big problem
if he doesn't get better soon.
960
Are you afraid they
won't be able to sell him?
961
Well, if they can't sell him,
we can't catch them in the act.
962
I thought since you're in the Department
for Women and Adolescentsâ¦
963
I thought you should've
cast your net a little
964
higher up the river
than the detectives.
965
Higher up the river?
966
Shouldn't you have saved her
first before she abandoned the baby?
967
That's the Department
of Health's job, okay?
968
Before she throws him away,
it's Department of Health's case.
969
After she abandons
him, it's the police's.
970
Seriously.
971
Team leader,
why are you so cold to that woman?
972
She's irresponsible.
973
Because she gave birth
to him and threw him away,
974
but we can't conclude
that she's the same.
975
Do you understand how a mother
feels about abandoning her child?
976
I guess I can't.
977
He can't do this.
This isn't a playground.
978
Right, yes, this is...
979
- Are you his father?
- Oh, yes...
980
- There are a lot of patients hereâ¦
- Okay.
981
- Please be careful.
- Yes, okay.
982
Are you Woosung's father?
983
Yeah, oh...
984
Yes.
985
What's his resident registration number?
986
- Got it?
- Yes.
987
Okay.
988
Actually, he's only one month old so...
989
- One month?
- Everyone was surprised.
990
Is it because of that
powdered milk? That...
991
That American brand... What was it?
992
Similac...
993
Similac.
994
- His grandmother is in the countryside.
- Yes.
995
- I wonder how many she sent me...
- I know.
996
She must be so happy
to have her first grandchild.
997
Okay, then, Woosung's
father, please come this way...
998
Oh, okay.
999
Gosh, that kid,
he plays soccer all the time...
1000
That's why the owner always squeaks.
1001
Jin jin ja ra, Jiri jiri ja.
1002
- Jin jin ja ra, Jiri jiri ja.
- What's wrong with him and how...
1003
Thank you for taking care of Woosung.
1004
Well, babies get fever and they grow up.
1005
If I were alone,
I wouldn't be able to do anything.
1006
You don't have to do it all by yourself.
1007
The father
1008
of Woosung?
1009
I was against it from the beginning.
1010
I see...
1011
She probably ran away with the baby.
1012
Find him and bring him back.
1013
The girl?
1014
The baby.
1015
What are you going to do with the baby?
1016
I'm going to raise him.
1017
I will.
1018
Because he's my husband's child.
1019
It's fully automatic?
Are you kidding me?
1020
How do you do this?
1021
Oh, Taeho.
1022
Uh, I'm sorry,
but I'll rush the money.
1023
What?
1024
Baby? Who, who?
1025
Woosung's father?
1026
How much?
1027
Four thousand?
1028
He's totally asleep.
1029
I guess he's tired.
1030
You've been worrying about him all day.
1031
He looks like Siwoo.
1032
These types don't
sell well and get left behind.
1033
Didn't you want to be adopted?
1034
I really liked it there.
1035
That's why I refused
to talk about adoption.
1036
Because your mom said she'd pick you up?
1037
What else did hyung tell you?
1038
Um, he told me about the letter.
1039
'Cause I never thought I'd be abandoned.
1040
He fell asleep.
1041
Do you want to try?
1042
Please just do me a favor.
1043
Put his chin on your shoulder.
1044
I know. I know.
1045
- No, a little higher.
- I said I know.
1046
- Hey, that's too weak...
- Oh, you're too loud, just...
1047
You're not taking care
of Woosung on purpose, are you?
1048
Huh?
1049
I'm afraid you won't be
able to part ways later.
1050
Why are you laughing?
1051
It's perfect for girls.
1052
Why are you saying
the same thing as hyung?
1053
Where are you going?
1054
Convenience store.
1055
Do you want me to go instead?
1056
There are things that
women can't ask others to do.
1057
Bring an umbrella in case it rains.
1058
Come and pick me up if it rains.
1059
With an umbrella.
1060
I don't want to.
1061
I'll be back.
1062
Where did you meet that mother?
1063
I was sleeping on Songdo beach
after running away from home,
1064
and she told me to come if I was hungry.
1065
And then you were
forced to prostitute yourself?
1066
Do you pity me?
1067
- No, that's not what I meant...
- I did it even before I met his mom.
1068
Then, why did you kill him?
1069
It's because of, well
1070
fit of rage?
1071
In a fit of rage?
1072
He's telling me to lick it before I
take a shower, that crazy bastard...
1073
So the first other person...
i mean, was it self-defense or...
1074
If you want to know the list of
the other customers, I can tell you.
1075
That's enough.
All I want to know is...
1076
Is this an interrogation? Or a sermon?
1077
Like I said, the baby
will be sold, so don't worry.
1078
My team leader
and I want to help you...
1079
Have you ever abandoned a child?
1080
Have you ever killed a man?
1081
Okay, then tell me,
because I don't understand.
1082
Why did you throw him away
outside the church?
1083
You saw that?
1084
If you left him like that, he'd be dead.
1085
That's because
I didn't want to see him again.
1086
Why did you give birth
to him if you couldn't raise him?
1087
Are you saying I
should've aborted him?
1088
If you're thinking about the child,
don't you have that option?
1089
Is it lighter crime
to kill the child
1090
before giving birth
than to throw it away
1091
after giving birth?
1092
Well...
1093
Since no one wants them,
1094
aren't babies more
unhappy when they're born?
1095
You're saying I should've
killed him before he was born?
1096
You talk like that
in front of Woosung?
1097
What did you mean by throwing him away?
1098
Yes.
1099
Uh, you know,
1100
can you get me some
clothes? My buttons fell off.
1101
Yes, in Uljin.
1102
Right?
1103
No, it's okay.
1104
Look at this.
Hold on. Listen to this song.
1105
Hello? Oh, can you hear
it? Do you remember this?
1106
In the movie we watched together...
1107
The one that came out...
1108
That's right.
1109
In reality, well,
that's not gonna happen.
1110
Rice? What rice?
1111
Oh, like in the wedding?
1112
Yes.
1113
No, I don't think so.
1114
Sorry.
1115
It's just.
1116
Poke it on the outside.
1117
Look at the bottom
of the button like this.
1118
If you spin it a few times,
if you spin it like this,
1119
it's not coming off.
1120
Wow, Dong-soo hyung,
how do you do that?
1121
- Hae-jin, try this one, too.
- I want to do it, too.
1122
I said try this one out, too.
1123
No, I want to do this.
1124
What kind of person are
you meeting tomorrow?
1125
Someone rich, of course.
1126
With that 40 million won...
1127
It's 3,000.
1128
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's 3,000, 3,000.
1129
Why? What kind of
person do you want it to be?
1130
Someone as pretty as So-young.
1131
Hey, Dong-soo, learn from him. Learn.
1132
You shouldn't let
a man say such empty words, man.
1133
Oh, I learned a lesson, Master.
1134
What?
1135
I couldn't hear you that well.
1136
In the past, it was said the
eldest son takes after
1137
his mom and the eldest
daughter takes after her dad.
1138
So our house is ruined.
1139
It's okay. We don't live together.
1140
That's all superstition.
1141
Oh, she's the eldest daughter.
1142
Shut up.
1143
Whenever I see pictures
of my mom, I get surprised.
1144
I thought it was me.
1145
The button was about to fall off.
1146
Now, okay.
1147
Where are you going?
1148
To wash up.
1149
Even he
1150
doesn't know his parents' faces either.
1151
Living without knowing...
1152
There are cases like that.
1153
It's better if Woosung
doesn't know my face.
1154
Why do you think so?
1155
Because I'm a murderer.
1156
Murder?
1157
Yes.
1158
Who'd you kill?
1159
Woosung's biological father.
1160
Why?
1161
He shouldn't have been born like this.
1162
I was going to take Woosung away.
1163
What?
1164
His wife is probably after me by now.
1165
So if you're going to sell it properly,
you can leave me behind.
1166
Uh, I'm out of the motel right now.
1167
Okay, hold on.
1168
Uh, wait.
1169
Let me ask you something.
1170
Hyung.
1171
What are you doing here?
1172
Well, what So young said yesterday
was on my mind, so I looked here.
1173
This...
1174
What's this?
1175
Is this GPS?
Where did you find this?
1176
Over here.
1177
Is it the police?
1178
The police don't use
old items like this these days.
1179
That means they've been following us.
1180
Don't you think so?
1181
Woosung's paternal side.
1182
I can't.
1183
Can't what?
1184
Hyung, you're thinking
of leaving So-young here.
1185
Well...
1186
This time, it's not money,
it's about convincing So young.
1187
Let's find her a buyer like that.
1188
Hey, man, money isn't everything.
1189
Then that's a relief.
1190
Then I'll take care of this myself.
1191
What?
1192
What are you doing now?
1193
I know everything.
1194
Woosung's dad is dead.
1195
Who cares?
You just need to get paid.
1196
I mean, who the hell is
trying to save Woosung?
1197
A dead man's wife.
1198
What is she going to
do after buying him?
1199
She wanted to raise him.
1200
Raise him?
Let's not talk nonsense.
1201
You're trying to sell
him out, aren't you?
1202
You're going abroad, huh?
I will never sell him.
1203
Come out, mister. Come out.
1204
Hey, hey.
1205
Who the hell are you?
1206
I see.
1207
Are you from Woosung's father's side?
1208
Shut up. Give me the kid. Hey, are
you not coming out? Come out! Come out!
1209
Hey, hey, hey.
1210
Hey, isn't he dead?
1211
Hey, he's the son of
someone I know, you punk.
1212
It's okay. He just passed out.
1213
Let's do it together.
1214
Where are they going now?
1215
Oh, they're heading
south along this road.
1216
I think we can
catch up with them in about 5km.
1217
- Speed up a little bit.
- Okay.
1218
I let my guard down.
1219
Oh.
1220
I had a dream.
1221
Once, my daughter,
1222
wife, and mom rode
this and went to Wolmido.
1223
And then...
1224
That's a nice dream.
1225
No, not really.
1226
Why do you think she
showed it to us on purpose?
1227
- Their destination?
- Yes.
1228
I guess she wants us to follow them.
1229
You mean not to lose Woosung?
1230
I guess that's what she's thinking.
1231
Are you gonna be okay?
1232
It's on me.
1233
That's not what I meant.
1234
I'm just going by myself if I have to.
1235
Even so, it's fine.
1236
As long as it's not
like installments or anything like that.
1237
- So-young.
- Yes?
1238
You put Woosung in the box.
1239
I mean, were you
really going to pick him up again?
1240
No.
1241
I don't know.
1242
But...
1243
If we have met a little earlier...
1244
I wouldn't have had to throw him away.
1245
It's not too late.
1246
Huh? What was that?
1247
Oh, nothing.
1248
So-young only has you, Mr. Sang-hyun.
You're too mean.
1249
Really? Okay, touch the baton then.
1250
What kind of man do you like, noon a?
1251
Huh?
1252
I'm not sure.
1253
A guy who looks good
in overalls like you?
1254
Hae-jin, that's a nice name.
1255
I like your name.
1256
That means heading to the sea, right?
1257
When you grow up,
I'm sure you'll be working abroad.
1258
In the Premier League?
1259
That's right.
1260
Who named Woosung?
1261
I did.
1262
Sounds wonderful.
1263
What does Woosung mean?
1264
Woo means wings,
1265
Sung means star.
1266
It means I want him to go far away.
1267
If Heajin is going to the sea,
then Woosung is over there,
1268
beyond the sky going
to the stars, like this.
1269
Just like an astronaut?
1270
Or a pilot?
1271
You two look like siblings.
1272
Oh, yes, hello?
1273
Well, I'd like to make
an appointment for an hour or two.
1274
I'll see you at 12:00. Yeah, yeah.
1275
All right, okay.
1276
Today's star is Woosung.
1277
Understand?
1278
- If they adopt me...
- No, never.
1279
Oh, thank you so much
for doing us a favor.
1280
I've already told you this,
1281
but my wife had a stillborn...
1282
I don't want to think about
the next time, so...
1283
Yes, you must have had a hard time.
1284
It was a girl.
1285
She was a cute baby
that looked like him...
1286
Oh, let's sit down
and have some coffee...
1287
Oh, how about ice coffee?
1288
Okay.
1289
Can I hold him?
1290
Oh, sure, yes.
1291
Excuse me...
1292
Yes, iced coffee.
1293
- One, two, three...
- Woosung.
1294
It's all right, I'm not scary.
1295
Maybe he's hungry?
1296
- Get the formula.
- Is he hungry?
1297
- Oh, yes.
- If it's okay...
1298
Do you mind if
I try breastfeeding him?
1299
It's fine, right?
1300
Okay, then, i...
Over there, yes.
1301
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you, yeah.
1302
Woosung.
1303
It's okay, it's all right.
1304
Oh, how...
1305
Drink, drink it, yes.
Yes, go ahead.
1306
Oh, good.
1307
Oh, that's good.
1308
I didn't write it in the mail,
1309
but can I make a suggestion?
1310
I was thinking, in the future...
1311
I want to raise Woosung as my own child.
1312
So I don't want Woosung
1313
to meet his biological
mother after this.
1314
I'm sure it'll be hard,
1315
so think about it slowly today.
1316
No on a, noon a, over here.
Here, here, here.
1317
Wow, that turned out good.
1318
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
1319
It's a monorail. Bye.
1320
Good bye.
1321
Let's take a picture here.
Let's take a picture.
1322
Come in, hurry.
1323
Do you have money?
1324
4,000 won.
1325
What prize do you want?
1326
No, not yet, not yet.
I haven't tried it yet.
1327
Hold on, hold on.
1328
The monkey doll,
the monkey doll!
1329
- The monkey doll.
- I'm screwed.
1330
I can't make a mistake, huh?
1331
Wai, wait.
1332
- I want to try it too.
- Go! Go! Go!
1333
I want to try, too.
1334
Hae-jin, there's a soccer field
Look.
1335
- Okay.
- Yeah?
1336
- That's the soccer field.
- Okay.
1337
I'm scared right now.
I'm afraid of heights.
1338
Oh, my
But you said wanted to ride it.
1339
Back then, I was just...
1340
Hey, what's wrong with your face?
1341
Hey, you're not going
to throw up, are you?
1342
Why are you so blue?
Are you okay?
1343
- Hey, you can't throw up here.
- Okay.
1344
- Huh?
- Okay.
1345
- Don't throw up here.
- Okay.
1346
Gosh, this kid. I tried to be
nice to you like a mother, but...
1347
Take me there.
1348
- Where?
- The new car...
1349
- Huh?
- New car...
1350
- A new car? A new car?
- Yeah.
1351
You mean, with the water
on top, you like that?
1352
Yes.
1353
Okay, let's come back
when things go well tomorrow.
1354
When we get there, - Yes.
1355
Tell me.
1356
Sure, yes.
1357
- Don't throw up.
- Okay.
1358
Oh, this kid, gosh...
1359
Should we look for more?
1360
Or you can quit.
You can send him for adoption.
1361
Still...
1362
Then
1363
we can raise him.
1364
We?
1365
The four of us...
1366
The five of us, with
Hae-jin, that sounds nice.
1367
What a weird family.
Who's father is who's dad?
1368
I'll be Woosung's dad.
1369
That's what people usually say
when they propose, you know?
1370
Is that so?
1371
I wish I could start over like that.
1372
But it won't work.
1373
I'm gonna be arrested soon.
1374
Moon, a prostitute in Busan,
1375
killed a man and ran away.
1376
When the baby got in the way,
she throws it away in the baby box.
1377
Does it come out like this?
1378
They don't blur the face these days.
1379
Oh, yeah?
1380
It shook a bit, right?
1381
It's okay. It's because
we're at the top.
1382
I'm scared 'cause
I can't see anything.
1383
It's weird...
1384
I feel a bit relaxed
when I see you.
1385
Why is that?
1386
My mother...
1387
I thought there might be
a reason why she had to abandon me.
1388
But still...
1389
You don't have to forgive her.
1390
Because it doesn't change
the fact that she's a terrible mother.
1391
That's why.
1392
I will forgive you instead.
1393
Woosung will never forgive me.
1394
You threw away Woosung
1395
because you didn't
want to make him a murderer's child.
1396
But still,
1397
I threw him away.
1398
I guess I was the one
who wanted to sell him the most.
1399
We're more like brokers.
1400
Was it when you were young?
1401
You were in my arms
1402
you almost threw up, but...
1403
You didn't throw up.
I hugged you against my stomach.
1404
I don't remember.
I was 3 years old.
1405
Has it been that long?
1406
How can you solve
such a difficult question already?
1407
Why? Who is it?
1408
Mom.
1409
Why? Answer it.
1410
What? Is it a text message?
1411
Text her back.
1412
Should we take a
selfie and send it to her?
1413
It's fine.
1414
Here's your order.
Enjoy your meal.
1415
Dig in. It looks delicious.
1416
Dad will have
a lot of money coming tomorrow.
1417
Then like in the past,
1418
the three of us in Busan.
1419
Oh, daddy can come to Seoul...
1420
Now that you have money,
please don't contact me again.
1421
That's what mom said.
1422
Mom did...
1423
But she seriously told me
don't ever come back home.
1424
Last time, daddy was so drunk.
1425
Oh, this straw is
1426
a heart. It's shaped like a heart.
1427
You know what,
1428
the baby's going to be born soon.
1429
Mom's?
1430
Yes, a boy.
1431
Oh, I see.
1432
Well, then tell your
mom congratulations.
1433
Sorry.
1434
Oh, don't be.
1435
But I'll continue to be your dad.
1436
Right?
1437
Really?
1438
Of couse.
1439
I better go.
1440
Let's meet again.
1441
Steak, steak...
1442
Should I try that?
1443
Anyway, I wish you success tomorrow...
1444
Here.
1445
Here...
1446
Woosung, say, "Hae-jin hyung."
1447
"Hae-jin hyung. Hae-jin hyung."
1448
Oh! He said Hae-jin.
1449
That must be you.
1450
- Woosung, did you? Right?
- That's right, he did.
1451
Woosung, you must never forget it.
1452
He will forget it soon.
1453
You just have to remember everything,
even on Woosung's behalf.
1454
Gosh, this kid. No matter how
you look at it, he's really unfortunate.
1455
I totally agree.
1456
Woosung, we really had fun today,
1457
so let's not forget
about today in the future.
1458
So young doesn't talk to Woosung.
1459
No?
1460
No, I've never seen it before either.
1461
It's the last day. Say something.
1462
What should I say?
1463
Well, anything.
1464
Well, "Thank you for being born." there.
1465
Well, people usually say
something like that, what?
1466
He doesn't even understand anything.
1467
Even if he doesn't understand
1468
he would want to
hear it at least once...
1469
Sister, then tell us everything.
1470
- Everything?
- Yes.
1471
- Everything, here?
- Yes!
1472
This idiot.
1473
I'll pass.
1474
What?
1475
If she talks first to him...
1476
Then, I'll pass, too.
1477
Fine, I'll talk to him.
1478
Everyone, close your eyes, then.
1479
W-Wait, wait a second!
1480
Let's turn off the light.
1481
What, hey!
1482
If you turn off the lights,
How can I eat my steak...
1483
Hey! Don't turn off the lights.
1484
Don't turn it off...
1485
Okay, I'm going to start.
1486
Hae-jin, thank you for being born.
1487
Sang-hyun,
1488
thank you for being born.
1489
Dong-soo,
1490
thank you for being born.
1491
Woosung,
1492
thank you
1493
for being born.
1494
So-young,
1495
So young, thank you for being born, too.
1496
Now, now, let's sleep everyone.
1497
Good night.
1498
I'll make a suggestion.
1499
Let's say you turn yourself in.
1500
What?
1501
Woosung...
You don't have to sell him anymore.
1502
What, you said to sell him,
and now I shouldn't?
1503
If you turn yourself in,
1504
you'll be on parole
for the first time in three years.
1505
Then, you can live with
Woosung again someday.
1506
Those two people
1507
cannot become parents, I'm afraid.
1508
I agree.
1509
The couple I met today was like that.
1510
Woosung is not abandoned,
he's a protected child.
1511
He'll grow up talking
about that every day.
1512
I hope Woosung grows up
under that kind of people.
1513
Then..
1514
Then..
1515
He doesn't have to live like me.
1516
Where are you going?
1517
So-young isn't here either.
1518
So young is probably meeting
with the detectives outside right now.
1519
So-young is not the type to sell us out.
1520
No, it can happen.
1521
She'll do anything for Woosung.
1522
But
1523
she can do that.
1524
You too, man. You'll find out
when you become a parent.
1525
Will So-young
1526
be able to start over
if she sells us out?
1527
Of course.
1528
No matter what,
1529
with Woosung.
1530
If you go ahead,
I'll catch up with you in a while.
1531
Hey, come here.
1532
- Hey, Taeho.
- Come here.
1533
- I need to talk to you.
- Come on.
1534
- Wait.
- Let go.
1535
You haven't given up yet?
Hey, wait.
1536
Of course, so don't ask.
1537
Hey, think about it too.
1538
If that woman raises that kid,
I don't think he'll grow up.
1539
Would that make you happy? Huh?
1540
Why are you pretending to be nice, huh?
1541
You're just a broker.
Seriously, come on, let go.
1542
- Oh, seriously.
- I need to talk to you.
1543
Hey, come on.
1544
Do business with me
with that 40 million won, huh?
1545
That's bullshit.
Why would I do that with you?
1546
I don't work with Dong-soo anymore.
1547
What?
1548
I don't know what to do with them.
1549
I don't need them anymore...
1550
She scolded me
a lot for saying that yesterday.
1551
You suddenly brought that up.
1552
We're being rude to his mother.
1553
So, uh
1554
you can call us whenever
you want to see him.
1555
Please tell his mother, please.
1556
I don't want to hide anything from him.
1557
I think it would be okay
1558
even if we would send away
1559
Woosung to people like you.
1560
Oh? Who is that?
1561
Maybe Sang-hyun.
1562
Yes, who are you?
1563
This is the police.
1564
No, this is... What is this?
May I help you?
1565
I need you to come with me
on charges of illegal child trafficking.
1566
Honey.
1567
You stay in there for a second.
1568
Well, wait a minute. I'll go out...
1569
Mr. Kim Dong-soo? You're under
arrest for human trafficking charges.
1570
Dong-soo hyung!
1571
Where is So-young?
1572
She turned herself in.
1573
What about the other one?
1574
I don't know.
1575
- Take him away.
- Yes.
1576
Let's go.
1577

Woosung!
1596
Woosung!
1597
Did you have fun?
Shall we go in the water?
1598
Let's go in.
1599
I love it. I love it.
