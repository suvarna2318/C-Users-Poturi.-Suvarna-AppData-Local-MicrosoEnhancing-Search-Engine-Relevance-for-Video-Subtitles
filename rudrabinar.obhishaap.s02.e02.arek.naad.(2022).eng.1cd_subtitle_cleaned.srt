Listen to me, Saaz.
2
Where are you going?
3
Try to understand, Saaz.
4
Why are you being so stubborn?
5
Let's go back to Kolkata.
6
Your visa is in process.
You'll fly off to USA soon.
7
I've made all the arrangements
in Berkeley.
8
Why waste your time here?
9
Dad, the police might not find
any abnormalities.
10
But take it from me.
11
I'm sure Mom and Salamat Uncle
have been murdered
12
- That's ridiculous...
- Even Alap thinks so.
13
Trust me.
14
That murderer is definitely somewhere
near Anandagarh.
15
And he's up for a bigger mission.
16
He deserves to be punished.
17
I can't run away like a coward
until he is punished.
18
Saaz...
19
please listen to me.
20
This might put your life at risk.
21
- Bahadur said so too.
- I don't care what others say.
22
I can't just escape.
23
I've never disobeyed you and Mom.
24
But please...
25
don't ask me to do this.
26
I can't keep running away
from my guilty conscience
27
for the rest of my life.
28
I can't, Dad.
29
Saaz, liste...
30
Saaz.
31
Greetings, maâam.
32
Huh?
33
How's your mother?
Is she okay now?
34
Yes, ma'am.
35
You could've stayed with her
for a few more days.
36
Since you said she stays alone.
37
She asked me to come back.
38
Because I was missing out
on rehearsals.
39
Very well.
40
Rest for a while.
41
- We'll rehearse later.
- Okay, ma'am.
42
Hmm.
43
- Ma'am.
- Yes?
44
The police commissioner in my village
45
asked me to visit the police station
when I get here.
46
I followed his instructions.
47
- Fine.
- Okay.
48
Come in, Bahadur.
49
- Did you repair the tabla?
- Yes.
50
Great.
51
It's good to see
you're back to normal.
52
- New student?
- Hmm?
53
Yes.
54
He has a wonderful voice.
55
But he's very poor.
56
With proper guidance,
he'll go a long way.
57
We need to find out
more about him.
58
Things started going wrong
since he came here.
59
The police are already investigating it.
60
Besides, seven other students
have been admitted with him.
61
Hmm.
62
Then all of them are suspects.
63
What's his name?
64
Naad Shankar... Das.
65
Naad Shankar Das.
66
(humming)
67
Hey!
68
Son of a bâªâªâªh!
69
Hey!
70
Wait!
71
Stop!
72
Wait!
73
Hey!
74
Stop!
75
CURSE OF THE RUDRABINA

CURSE OF THE RUDRABINA
PART 2
77
Damn it!
78
Uff!
79
Alap.
80
Alap.
81
Naad took the box and the disc.
82
With the disc!
83
Alap, he escaped.
84
Doesn't matter.
85
- What?
- He'll have to come back to me.
86
I'll kill that rascal!
87
- Bahadur Uncle.
- Yes?
88
Who is this Naad?
89
Someone from Rudrapur?
90
He killed my son and daughter.
91
And your sister?
92
Who killed your sister?
93
What do you mean?
94
Found this pen
at Master Kedar's farmhouse.
95
There's a symbol on the nib.
96
We saw the same symbol...
97
on Salamat Uncle
and Noor Aunty's dead bodies.
98
It's there on Naad's back as well.
99
How is Master Kedar
connected to this symbol?
100
We thought Master Kedar was like you,
a descendant of Madanti.
101
That maybe to protect himself...
102
he concealed his identity
and lived in Anandagarh.
103
But it seems
that he had other intentions.
104
What are you saying?
105
Bahadur Uncle...
106
please tell us what happened.
107
Did Grandpa want
to kill Grandma?
108
I don't know!
109
I don't know.
110
I don't know anything.
Please spare me!
111
Fine.
112
We'll let you go.
113
But let me make this clear.
114
I will get to the bottom of this.
115
Let's go, Shruti.
116
This solitude is painful
117
Make me yours
118
The burning candles call out
119
Put them out
120
Come let's explore each other
121
Will the night ever end
122
If we make love?
123
This solitude is painful
124
Make me yours
125
The burning candles call out
126
Put them out
127
Come let's explore each other
128
Will the night ever end
129
If we make love?
130
This solitude is painful
131
Make me yours
132
Your burning touch
Melts this fragile glass
133
I lose myself
In your passionate glance
134
I give in To your loving touch
135
The stars hold the secret
To your passionate glance
136
This solitude is painful
137
Make me yours
138
The burning candles call out
139
Put them out
140
Come let's explore each other
141
Will the night ever end
142
If we make love?
143
This solitude is painful
144
Make me yours
145
Are you sure it was this symbol?
146
Yes, brother.
147
Remember what you told me?
148
To let you know
if I see someone with this symbol.
149
What does this symbol mean?
150
Mumtaz.
151
Kedar Mishra is not a nice man.
152
He wants to kill you.
153
- What?
- Yes.
154
What are you saying?
155
It can't be true.
156
I don't believe you...
157
Ask Grandfather
if you don't believe me.
158
But don't worry.
159
Nobody can harm you
as long as I'm alive.
160
Hail Rudrabhairav!
161
What's the matter, Naad?
162
Why is it taking so long
to finish the work?
163
I request you to have patience.
164
I'm on it.
165
Huh! Are you?
166
Or has the Nawab's granddaughter
made you forget your resolve?
167
Hmm?
168
Naad, I sent you here
169
to find Madanti's descendants
and finish them.
170
I arranged for Nawab Amanat Khan
to give you music lessons.
171
What for?
172
Only so that you can stay here.
173
Your suspicion is baseless..
174
I was the one who found
and killed Madanti's son Abdul.
175
That was long back.
176
What's taking you so long
to find Abdul's descendants?
177
I'm almost done.
178
I will bring the corpse before you soon.
179
Listen, Naad.
180
You wanted freedom from your life as Naad
after marrying Mumtaz.
181
I have not objected to that.
182
But if you don't finish the job...
183
I'll destroy your family.
184
I give you seven more days.
185
Proceed.
186
Rascal!
You want to kill my sister?
187
I'll finish you before that...
188
You better not reveal
anything you heard.
189
Or there'll be consequences.
190
Please come, Rudrabhairav.
191
He was Abdul's only son.
192
He was in hiding.
193
I've found out
that Abdul does not have anymore children.
194
Madanti's lineage ends with him.
195
Please release me now.
