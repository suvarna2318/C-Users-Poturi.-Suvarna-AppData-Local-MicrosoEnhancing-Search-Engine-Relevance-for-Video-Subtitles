Extremely Polite Yumi</i>

<i>Yumi.</i>
4
<i>Should we...</i>
5
<i>get married?</i>
6
<i>Let's get married.</i>
7
The sky is pretty.
8
- Eonni Yi Da, good morning!
- Hey, good morning.
9
Wow. It's been so long since she made a comeback on here.
10
I'm talking about Yumi. She uploaded a post. What's going on?
11
Really? I'll have to leave a comment.
12
<i>A nice day for a change. Spring. A new feeling. A good hunch.</i>
13
So she just uploaded it.
14
Wait. This isn't just a normal picture of a ring.
15
Why?
16
- Hello?
- Hey, is there something going on?
17
<i>Huh?</i>
- Hurry up and come clean, something good happened, right?
18
Listen. Ruby and Writer Yumi are having dinner together today.
19
I'm going to act like I came to look for Ruby and join in.
20
Then if Hyeong and Hyeong Wung act like you
just happened to come to that restaurant for dinner
21
I'll naturally invite you to join us.
22
So I'll get there first and you guys
come in ten minutes later. Then we'll meet.
23
But you said that Yumi is dating her
ex-boyfriend again. So isn't it already game over?
24
No, no, no. Don't dare call yourself a
person if you haven't tried your best.
25
Isn't that something that stalkers say?
26
So you don't trust me, Hyeongnim.
27
You can trust me when it comes to dating.
28
Why?
29
Do you know why people call me Control Z?
30
No, but I'm not really that curious.
31
It's a bit embarrasing to say it myself,
32
but I'm a dating expert.
33
You must have a lot of dating experience then.
34
Rather than a lot, it's deep.
35
Then, how many times...?
36
You know that how deep your relationships are is
more important than how many you've had, right?
37
I'm the type who stays in a relationship
for a long time when I date. That's all I'll say.
38
I got it, so how many times?
39
Three times, officially.
40
Three times?
41
Three times. Hey, I've been in over seven relationships!
42
How dare you act like a know-it-all when you've only dated three times?
43
- Hey.
- Huh?
44
You said seven times? You?
45
Yeah.
46
Really?
47
Well...
48
I'm saying it's seven times if you include flirting.
49
You said it's seven times if you include flirting?
50
Hyeongnim, I would have been in a
relationship over 30 times if I included flirting.
51
Wait, if you've only dated seven times
including flirting, then this is serious.
52
Hyung Wung, I'm telling you that Yumi is lonely right now.
53
Although they're back together, it's awkward.
54
A relationship like this can't last long.
55
Now's your chance.
56

57
<i>Ruby.</i>
58
Hello?
59
- Oppa Z!
<i>Hey, Ruby. I was planning to call you...</i>
60
Oppa Z! Big news! Big news!
61
Eonni Yumi said she's getting married!
62
<i>With Team Leader Ba Bi. She said he proposed to her.</i>
63
<i>I thought things weren't going well for them, but this is a big twist!</i>
64
<i>Oh, I have to go to a meeting. I'll call you back.</i>
65
- Wait...
- Are you telling me that Yumi's getting married to her ex-boyfriend right now?
66
Hello?
67
<i>What are you up to?</i>
68
I'm drinking coffee, cleaning, and cooking.
69
I didn't tell you yesterday, did I?
70
<i>Tell me what?</i>
71
I've always had a feeling that I'd live happily when I got married.
72
Based on what?
73
A strong signal came to me from the future.
74
What are you saying?
75
But I became certain that it's not just a hunch yesterday.
76
I think we'll be happy.
77
You don't have much going on today,
right? Do you want to go out for lunch?
78
Lunch? I'm making a lunchbox right now.
79
There was somewhere I wanted to go with you.
80
Where?
81
Your father?
82
<i>Huh? Aunt, Su Cheol didn't get divorced.
It was the younger sibling that got divorced.</i>
83
<i>Su Cheol doesn't have a younger sibling.</i>
84
<i>What? Why doesn't he have a younger sibling? There's two of them.</i>
85
<i>What's the youngest one's name?</i>
86
<i>What is it?</i>
87
<i>Yumi grew up around a lot of adult relatives from a
young age, so she never found it difficult to interact with adults.</i>
88
<i>Do you have a boyfriend? Did you get a job?</i>
89
<i>No, I don't have a boyfriend, and I'm getting ready to get a job.</i>
90
<i>Is that so?</i>
91
<i>However...</i>
92
<i>It's different with her boyfriend's father.
Babi's Street Food</i>
93
But is it okay for me to suddenly come see him?
94
I thought that you'd feel more burdened if we made plans to see him.
95
So we can say that we decided to stop in since we were passing by,
96
greet him, and then leave.
97
Let's take the official meeting slow.
98
- Let's go in.
- Okay.
99
Welcome.
100
Father!
101
I stopped by.
102
Why did you come here with your foot like that? You should be at home.
103
I came with my girlfriend.
104
That's Ba Bi's father?
105
He doesn't look like his son at all.
106
He looks scarier than his picture.
107
He looks like an actor.
108
Who does he look like?
109
Move!
110
You all need to get yourselves together!
111
Is it important which actor he looks like right now?
112
He's going to be our father-in-law!
113
Marriage? Don't you know if we make
a mistake, we'll get intercepted here!
114
Say hi. He's my father.
115
Hello, nice to meet you. I'm Kim Yumi.
116
Nice to meet you.
117
You should have let me know you were coming.
118
Sorry. We happened to have an
appointment in the area, so we just stopped by.
119
We thought it would be good to say hello.
120
Oh, I got this...
121
Yu Mi bought it to give it to you.
122
You didn't have to.
123
Oh it's nothing, it's just snacks.
124
We don't have any food because lunchtime
is over. We've only got tteokbokki left now.
125
Oh, no, it's okay. I really like tteokbokki.
126
<i>Tteokbokki, Soondae, Ramen, Kimbap</i>
127
The atmosphere is so nice.
128
It's been around for a while, so it's a bit old-fashioned, isn't it?
129
No, that makes it better! It really seems like it will be delicious.
130
My father is usually quite blunt. Especially since my mother died.
131
Yeah, you told me.
132
He's not doing it to you specifically, so don't worry about it.
133
What is it, Bon Hui?
134
I'm outside at the moment.
135
What?
136
I'll send it to you as a photo.
137
Fax? But why...
138
Yes, I understand. I'll call you once I've sent it.
139
Yu Mi, just a second.
140
Do you need to go somewhere?
141
I'll just send a fax and then I'll be back.
142
I'll go.
143
No, I need to go myself.
144
Father, the stationary store is open, right?
145
Of course, it's open.
146
What is the highest form of respect you
can show to someone who made you food?
147
Of course it's to eat everything
deliciously so there's nothing left over!
148
Exactly! That is the highest form of respect.
149
Hold on, this...
150
Father, that's too much.
151
Leave some.
152
So much...
153
I'll be right back. Eat.
154
Okay, come quickly.
155
How many portions is that exactly?! 3? 4?
156
Even if it's respectful, this is too much.
157
One second. Don't be scared already.
158
Ba Bi's Street Food's tteokbokki is made
of wheat rice cakes. That's my preference.
159
Then shall I quickly get started on this difficult task?
160
Who are you? You're going to take all of us on?
161
You'd better prepare yourselves!
162
There isn't a tteokbokki target I don't know.
163
I think he's serious!
164
Where are you running to?
165
My back!
166
You can't run away from this plate!
167
I'm not a rice cake, I'm green onion.
168
Sorry, you look like a rice cake.
169
It's delicious, so delicious. Even the green onion is good.
170
It can't compare to what you get at a food cart.
171
Yumi! You need to eat modestly here.
172
Don't jump around.
173
She's not saying anything. Does it not suit her taste?
174
No, that's not it.
175
Look at her feet bouncing.
176
<i>Bouncing feet: Something you do when eating delicious food.</i>
177
<i>It's like a standing ovation at a performance.</i>
178
<i>And she's even sweeping up the sauce.</i>
179
<i>Sweeping up the soup: Mopping up the leftover tteokbokki
sauce. The highest form of praise in the tteokbokki industry.</i>
180
<i>Yu Mi scored highly on her first impression.</i>
181
You ate all of this? Alone?
182
It was so yummy...
183
- Oh, I'll...
- No need.
184
Yu Mi must have really liked your tteokbokki.
185
There's none for you.
186
I'm okay.
187
If you're done eating, get going.
188
Okay.
189
Is he angry?
190
No. He's usually like that.
191
We'll be going now.
192
Bye.
193
- Should we go?
- I'm just going to pop to the bathroom.
194
Okay.
195
He's so stiff. I have no idea what to say.
196
<i>Still, we can't just eat and leave.</i>
197
Of course we can't just go.
198
In that case... it's metamorphosis.

It was really delicious.

220
That's enough. What's so special about tteokbokki?
221
I'm sorry for visiting so unexpectedly.
222
Next time, we'll be sure to contact you before we come.
223
It's nothing. As for me, well it would be nice if you came again.
224
And I'm glad you enjoyed the tteokbokki.
225
In that case, please do be going.
226
Okay. I'll come and visit you again.

Did I make a mistake?
233
You did well. What mistake? He'll like it if you pop by occasionally.
234
One second.
235
What is it?
236
- Yu Mi-yah.
- Yes?
237
Here.
238
Buy something delicious to eat.
239
Take it.
240
Thank you.
241
Come over to hang out again.
242
Yes, Father.
â« <i>I only wanna be with you everyday</i> â«
243
â« <i>Your smile makes my heart dance</i> â«
244
I'll buy you something since I got
spending money. What do you want to drink?
245
Do you know what my father's nickname is?
246
What is it?
247
Scrooge Jeong.
248
Why? He gave me this much spending money.
249
I've never gotten any.
250
Really?
251
Know that you're the first person to
ever get spending money from my father.
252
Wow. Then I shouldn't use this and laminate it to commemorate.
253
Hang it up on the wall.
254
I should iron this and laminate it.
255
Wow, you're rich.
256
<i>Yumi safely made it through the first hurdle on the road to marriage.</i>
257
You know that's really important, right?
258
I'm jealous. I've never gotten any from him before.
259
I'll get a lot from him.

Is this the throat?
264
Here!
265
Who are you?!
266
Knock the throat!
267
I am a cold virus!
268
Then I just have to send it by the weekend, right?
269
That would be good. But will you be able to?
270
I'll edit it. There's isn't a lot...
271
Writer, did you catch a cold?
272
I don't know. My throat stings.
273
- Okay. I'll see you next week.
<i>- Okay!</i>
274
Should I drink some ginger tea?
275
Hey! Where is that jerk Cold?

I'll make him aware of the greatness

291
Hello? Ba Bi.
292
Have you taken medicine? What about food?
293
I'm at the pharmacy now.
294
Shall I stop by for a bit?
295
<i>No. I think I'll get better if I just rest today.</i>
296
I think it would be best if I stop by for a bit.
297
I'm really okay. I'm sorry.
298
No, get some rest.
299
<i>- Okay. I'll call you later.
- Okay.</i>
300
Should I not have told him? He'll worry.
301
<i>Yumi, are you busy?</i>
302
<i>I came to Ilsan for work, so I thought of you.</i>
303
<i>I'm not at home. What is it?</i>
304
<i>There's no reason for us to meet since
we're not working together or friends,</i>
305
<i>but do you want to have a cup of coffee?</i>
306
Alright, Yumi is coming soon. Let's speak coolly.
307
As if we're just asking how she's doing.
308
Show me the best answer.
309
<i>[Which of the following is the coolest way to greet Yumi?]

310
<i>B. I heard you got a proposal? Good for you.</i>
311
<i>C. Mr. Yu Ba Bi is a good man. You made a good decision.</i>
312
A good man? Yeah, right.
313
Does he really have to say that?
314
Hey. Hey, Love. Calm down.
315
We can just brush past it.
316
Do we really have to call her out and say this?
317
Love! This is something that makes Yumi happy.
318
It's the same as leaving comments on her web novel.
319
What's so hard about wishing her well?
320
I don't want to do it! Why do I have to go this far?
321
Wung.
322
Hey. You made it?
323
What do you want to drink?
324
Nothing.
325
I had some tea right before I came, so I'm okay.
326
Are you sick?
327
I must have a cold. I'm okay.
328
How have you been?
329
What about your finger?
330
It's fine.
331
That's a relief.
332
Congratulations.
333
Huh?
334
About that.
335
That?
336
You getting that thing.
337
Being proposed to.
338
Thank you.
339
I didn't think that you'd say that to me.
340
Thank you.
341
No need to be thankful.
342
Look at that. Yumi's happy.
343
<i>Don't get married, Yumi!</i>
344
I contacted you because I wanted to tell you that.
345
I could say it over the phone, but still...
346
Yeah.
347
When are you getting married?
348
Not right away. I think it will be
better after I finish writing the sequel.
349
So it will probably be late fall or winter.
We're thinking around November or December.
350
Oh, I see.
351
It's still far away, so it doesn't feel real.
352
Are you happy?
353
Yeah.
354
I think I am happy.
355
That's good.
356
Good.
357
When you get married, send me a wedding invitation, too.
358
I'm not sure.
359
Why?
360
You can't do that either because I'm your ex-boyfriend?
361
I'll discuss it with him.
362
With your boyfriend?
363
Yeah. I think I should ask him.
364
Then I won't be able to go. Would Yu Ba Bi allow it?
365
Why are you acting like that? Are you still upset with Ba Bi?
366
Do you have to get married to that guy?
367
If you're going to do it, can't you do it with some other guy instead?
368
Why does it have to be that guy?
369
Wung.
370
I'm saying these words for the first time in a long time.
371
What?
372
Goodness.
373
Goodness, Wung.
374
I'll take you home.
375
- That's okay.
- It's because you look sick.
376
I'm okay. My house is right around the corner.
377
Can I say one more thing?
378
Stop it.
379
Do you know what I regret the most in my life?
380
It's when I couldn't answer when you said let's get married.
381
I thought I would have another chance after I earned some money.
382
Do you love that guy?
383
Do you love him?
384
Of course! Yeah!
385
Huh? Why isn't she saying anything? Yeah!
386
<i>What are you doing? Yumi, you have to answer him!</i>
387
<i>Say that you love him! It's Wung!</i>
388
<i>She can't answer.</i>
389
- Why?
- Love isn't here!
390
Huh?
391
- Love!
392
- I haven't seen Love either.
- Love, where are you?
393
You're saying Love isn't here?
394
Love still hasn't come back.
395
Is that possible? Has no one seen Love?
396
- I haven't.
- No.
397
- Have you seen her?
- No.
398
Love is the only one who can answer if she loves him.
399
But you said that Love isn't here!
400
That's why she can't say yes.
401
Darn it! Then I'll just answer it!
402
Why are you asking something so obvious?!
403
Why are you asking something so obvious? How childish.
404
I've always been childish. You know that.
405
Hurry up and go.
406
Bye.
407
Go home.
408
<i>When I wondered what love was, I realized
it was when I couldn't control how I felt.</i>
409
<i>Congratulations. Be happy.</i>

Hey! Why won't you die? It's 39Â°C (102.2Â°F) out here!
411
It's still bearable. Why?!
412
Hey! We'll all die first at this rate.

Do you have to go this far just to get rid of one cold?
416
You stupid fool...
417
You're crazy!
418
We'll all die. Lower the fever.
419
We don't have a temperature-lowering function, though.
420
Wait, are you determined to kill Yumi?!
421
Huh? She suddenly got cool.
422
<i>It's Ba Bi.</i>
423
Are you okay?
424
- When did you get here?
- A little while ago.
425
You've got a really high fever. Should we go to the hospital?
426
It's not that bad. What about work?
427
I worked outside the office and got off work from there.
428
Let's monitor it a little longer and go
to the hospital if it doesn't get any lower.
429
You didn't eat dinner either, did you? I'll make you something.
430
I'm not hungry.
431
Get some more sleep.
432

441
Who was it?
442
Father sent you some tteokbboki.
443
What?
444
I spoke with him on the phone earlier, and he asked me for your address when I
said that you're sick. <i>30 years of traditional tteokbboki - Babi's Street Food</i>
445
He said that since you eat tteokbboki so well,
you should eat some if you don't have an appetite.
446
Do you want some? The soup is almost ready, too.
447
I'm so thankful.
448
Have the soup first. Let's eat the
tteokbboki when you get a little better.
449
Okay.
450
Go back to sleep.
451
<i>I'm so touched.</i>
452
I'm so touched! I'm touched by Ba Bi and his father!
453
Why are they so sweet?
454
<i>When Yumi's sick, Sensitivity gets more excited than usual.</i>
455
Is sweetness hereditary for the men in this family?
456
That's crazy! I'm going crazy!
457
Ah, Yumi. Aren't you doing too well with your marriage?
458
Eat some more.
459
I ate a lot. It's so delicious.
460
Shall we take a look?
461
I think it went down a bit.
462
Aren't you going to eat dinner?
463
I'll take care of it. Go back to sleep.
464
I'll take this away.
465
Oh, that's right. Yumi, what do you think about Hawaii?
466
- Hawaii?
- I told you that my older sister lives in Hawaii, right?
467
What do you think about getting married
in Hawaii? I suddenly thought about it.
468
It was really nice every time I went to Nuna's house.
469
A small wedding in Hawaii?
470
A small wedding in Hawaii.
471
What? Are you saying that because you know?
472
My dream is to have a small wedding in Hawaii.
473
Really? I didn't know. How would I know that?
474
Then, you're saying it's really a coincidence?
475
Wow.
476
I like it! I love it.
477
I knew you would like it.
478
Get some more sleep. You're sick.
479
I think it would be nice to have a small wedding in Hawaii.
480
Yeah. Let's talk about it again later.
481
Go to sleep.
482
Ha-Hawaii?
483
Don't talk anymore. Go back to sleep.
484
You're sick.
485
I think I'd love to have a small wedding in Hawaii.
486
How can he be like this?
487
How could his Nuna live in Hawaii?
488
I thought that we'd end up having a small wedding in Hawaii with Wung.
489
You really never know how things will turn out.
490
Life is mysterious.
491
<i>When she's sick, she gets twice as touched and twice as annoyed.</i>
492
<i>She also fantasizes twice as much.</i>
493
Yumi, you're awake?
494
Your fever went down.
495
How do you feel?
496
I think I'm okay now.
497
Ba Bi, hurry up and go.
498
I'm not going to go.
499
You have to go to work tomorrow.
500
I'll just sleep here.
501
You seem like you've gotten a little better, so I'll go buy some beer.
502
A soccer game is on soon.
503
I'll have some beer before I go to bed.
504
I'll be back.
505
No, don't go.
506
I can't?
507
Go, go.

CEO, you're tired, aren't you? You couldn't
get any rest as soon as you came here.
525
I slept during the plane ride, so not really.
526
Miss Seo Yeon said she was bringing
clothes for you to change into earlier.
527
And this is your mail that came while you were on the business trip.
528
Why is there so much?
529
<i>Park Yong Seon, Lee Som Yi</i>
530
Yong Seon, that punk, is getting married.
531
Seok Ju is, too.
532
Are these guys all getting married in a row?
533
Why are they all wedding invitations?
534

535
<i>To: Gu Wung</i>
536
<i>When you get married, send me a wedding invitation, too.</i>
537
<i>I'm not sure. I'll discuss it with him.</i>
538
Alright, guys. Let's hold hands.
539
That day has finally come.
540
You've prepared your heart, right?
541
We got rid of all the lingering feelings.
542
We decided to calmly let Yumi go.
543
<i>It is a wedding invitation.
[Invitation]</i>
544
<i>Seriously...
[Invitation]</i>
545
<i>Why is the wedding invitation so pretty?</i>
546
<i>Yumi probably picked it out, right?</i>
547
<i>- I don't want to look at it.
- I don't want to see it.</i>
548
<i>- To think that her groom is Yu Ba Bi!
- Damnit.</i>

552
Okay.
553
<i>That's right, let's look at it later.</i>
554
<i>We'll ruin the speech for no reason.</i>
555
Mr. CEO, you're not going to the company. You're going home, right?
556
I'll go home and get some rest.
557
Please schedule the meeting after four o'clock.
558
Yes, sir.
559
- Please go to Hannam-do.
- Yes, sir.
560
<i>This is Yumi's neighborhood.</i>
561
<i>It's our old neighborhood, too.</i>
562
<i>That was when we had the least money, but were the happiest.</i>
563
One moment. Please stop the car.
564
Please take my luggage to my house and
leave it there. I'll head straight to the company.
565
Where are you going, CEO?
566
There's somewhere I want to visit for a bit.
567
Then it would be best to go by car.
568
<i>When he would get off work, Yumi would wait for him there.</i>
569
<i>Wung!</i>
570
<i>Come in!</i>
571
Put it there.
572
- Put it down there.
<i>Huh?</i>
573
<i>Isn't that sofa from Yumi's place?</i>
574
<i>You're right. That's Yumi's bookcase.</i>
575
Are they moving to Ba Bi's place?
576
Or to a new newlywed home?
577
Newlywed home?
578
Don't cry, Love.
579
We said we would smile when she gets married.
580
Stop!
581
<i>While we're here, let's say hi to Yumi before we go.</i>
582
<i>Yes, let's tell her we look forward to seeing her in her wedding dress.</i>
583
Yumi!
584
Yumi!
585
<i>It's the dining table that Wung bought.</i>
586
<i>The dining table that he bought with borrowed
money because he didn't have 150,000 won (â $114).</i>
587
We will take the dining table out now.
588
Sure, but where is the tenant?
589
Are you her husband?
590
No, I'm not.
591
I thought you were her husband.
592
She said she had to stop by somewhere for a bit and left.
593
Please be careful.
594
She's even taking that dining table to the newlywed home?
595
They're going to even eat at that dining table...
596
He didn't buy it for that to happen...
597
There you again! If you're going to be like this then let's just go.
598
We're not going to see Yumi.
599
Come on, let's just go. Come on.
600
- Let's just go.
- Let's just go.
601
Yes, the deposit went through. I verified it.
602
Thank you.
603
- Thank you.
- No problem.
604
- Get home safely.
- I will.
605
Wung!
606
It was you.
607
What are you doing here?
608
I had a lecture nearby, so I stopped by.
609
I see.
610
I'm here because of my house.
611
Congratulations.
612
You know?
613
Of course, I know.
614
So you heard. Thanks.
615
But I don't know if it was a good idea. The loan was a lot.
616
You took out the loan?
617
Of course, I would.
618
Is that necessary?
619
I don't have enough money, so what else would I do?
620
What the heck, Yu Ba Bi? You're making
Yumi take out a loan and getting married?
621
He has no conscience. If they're going to get married
like that then Wung would have married her by now!
622
That's right.
623
Guys, please stop!
624
I mean... well...
625
It's not my business.
626
I will pay back the debt slowly.
627
Exactly, why are you paying that debtâ
628
Yes, anyway, congratulations.
629
That's not important anyway.
630
Still, I'm excited.
631
As long as you are happy.
632
You got the wedding invitation, right? I sent it.
633
Yeah.
634
Are you going to come to the wedding?
635
Of course.
636
I'm glad.
637
Why? Did you think I wouldn't go?
638
Possibly. I thought it was a 50/50 chance.
639
It's too bad. It would have been nice to grab a coffee,
640
but I have to get back. They're moving out my things right now.
641
Head back. I'm also leaving now.
642
A taxi is coming.
643
- I'll get going.
- Okay.
644
I'll see you at the wedding.
645
Okay.
646
I will look forward to seeing you in a wedding dress.
647
What?
648
I think you will look really beautiful.
649
Bye.
650
What? Me?
651
<i>Hold on. Wasn't there something weird
about the end of that conversation just now?</i>
652
<i>It was weird. Something was off.</i>

654
<i>What the! What's this?</i>

<i>Kang Yi Da?!

657
<i>Yumi's friend, Kang Yi Da?</i>
658
<i>Yi Da was debating on whether she should give you a wedding invitation.</i>
659
<i>You told her to send her an invitation whenever she gets married.</i>
660
Sir, please go backwards!
661
Sure.
662
- Excuse me?!
- Please drive backwards. Backwards!
663
Right now?
664
I said go back! Go back!
665
<i>So I am sending one on her behalf.
She won't be hurt if you don't come. Yumi.</i>
666
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
667
Wung!
668
It's Yi Da's wedding.
669
What?
670
- The wedding invitation. It's Yi Da's wedding invitation.
- Yeah.
671
Then what we're you just talking about?
672
You weren't talking about coming to Yi Da's wedding?
673
Why are you moving?
674
- Moving?
- You moved out all of your things.
675
I saw them putting things into the moving van.
676
I bought my apartment.
677
I thought it was a waste to keep paying rent,
678
so I took my deposit and took out a loan to buy
the place even though it was a little impractical.
679
Since I bought it, I'm going to put in new wallpaper and flooring.
680
That's why I'm moving everything to storage.
681
You weren't congratulating me on buying a place?
682
No.
683
Then what were you talking about earlier?
684
- I thought you knew.
- What about you?
685
Me?
686
Your wedding?
687
Are you not getting married? It's been a while.
688
Oh...
689
I'm not.
690
Then when are you going to?
691
We broke up.
692
I guess you didn't know. I thought you heard.
693
Iâ I didn't know.
694
That's what happened.
695
I see.
696
I didn't know, sorry.
697
It's fine.
698
Then I'll see you at Yi Da's wedding.
699
All right.
700
I'll get going.
701
Okay.
702
Sir, let's go, please.
703
But why...
704

729
Okay.
730
Did you reply?
731
Huh?
732

733
That the tteokbokki arrived well.
734
Oh... No.
735
I will have to do it. I will call him later.
736
You don't have to. I will tell him later.

738
Of course, he would.
