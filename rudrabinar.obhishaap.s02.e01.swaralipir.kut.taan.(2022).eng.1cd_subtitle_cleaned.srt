The mystery
of Tansen's tanpura begins with...
2
the curse of the rudrabina?
3
"Sarod, sitar, flute,
santoor, shehnai...
4
sarangi, rudrabina."
5
Nawab Amanat Khan
had gifted each of us a disc.
6
Is this a clue to finding
Tansen's Raga Sanjivani?
7
Your singing and your work
has impressed us, Naad.
8
Your singing is full of mystery.
9
But it's lifeless.
10
You have to atone for the sins
of your ancestors, Naad.
11
Will you accept me as your student?
12
Of course.
13
Do you still have your disc?
14
"In the heart of Rudrapur
lies a Shiva lake
15
When the discs are aligned
16
And the notes are played
at twice the pace of time
17
Raga Sanjivani you shall find."
18
Was Salamat Uncle
Madanti's descendant?
19
You're hiding something
this time too.
20
Mom!
Can you hear me?
21
Mom!
22
Tell me, Bahadur.
23
Were Salamat and Noor...
24
murdered?
25
No matter what it takes...
26
I will unravel this mystery.

You...
29
You're Noor's father, Bahadur?
30
And all these years...
31
you kept it a secret?
32
Lolit.
33
You and Saaz should leave.
34
Dangerous...
35
They are dangerous.
36
- What if something happens to you...
- What will happen?
37
What do I have to lose?
38
Take Saaz and go away from here.
39
Bahadur.
40
Stay with us for a few days.
41
It's not safe for you
to stay alone.
42
You don't have to worry
about me.
43
Won't spare them.
44
I won't spare anyone.
45
- Bahadur.
- Lolit...

CURSE OF THE RUDRABINA

CURSE OF THE RUDRABINA
PART 2
48
Hey, where's everyone?
49
- Upstairs.
- Oh.
50
- All good?
- Yes.
51
Good morning.
52
Wow!
53
Everyone is here, huh.
54
You?
55
Why are you here?
56
To do my duty as a friend.
57
Lolit might not consider me his friend...
58
but I consider him a friend.
59
How can I not stand by him
in times of need?
60
Your skin should be displayed
in the museum
61
for rhinos and chameleons to see.
62
Hmm.
63
Everyone changes colour,
Pandit Ranjan Ghosh.
64
You defamed me.
65
That's how you got the National Music Award
meant for me.
66
- Now I know...
- Stop talking nonsense, Hemanta.
67
You?
68
- You're a disgrace to Anandagarh.
- Hmm.
69
There's just one problem.
70
You couldn't prove it in court.
71
You needed a better plan
to frame me.
72
- Hemanta.
- Yes?
73
I'm really not in the mood.
74
- Please leave.
- Right.
75
Lolit, I know this was a big loss for you.
76
But you can't break down, my friend.
77
Hemanta, whatever I might be...
78
I'm not a scoundrel like you.
79
Hmm.
80
So, I don't need your consolation.
81
Leave.
82
You still misunderstand me
for that characterless woman?
83
Hey, cut the crap.
84
Why aren't you throwing him out, Dad?
85
Hemanta, go away!
86
Just leave.
87
I better not see you here again.
88
My goodness!
89
So, everyone's out to insult me.
90
Fine.
91
I'll leave if you want me to.
92
All of you wronged Rohini.
93
But all the blame's on me now?
94
Good.
95
Great!
96
Just a minute.
97
Nawab Amanat Khan had given you
a disc
98
at your naming ceremony.
Do you have it?
99
Yes.
100
Why?
101
Can I take a look at it?
102
Just a look?
103
You can keep it.
104
I don't need it anymore.
105
Alap...
106
who do I have but you?
107
How can I get the disc?
108
It's in my bag right now.
109
Come with me.
110
He's carrying it with him!
111
Well, look at that.
112
You need my help, after all.
113
Hmm?
114
Come.
115
I always carry this with me.
116
It's a gift from the great guru,
after all.
117
Here you go.
118
Someone who can sell
his lover for money...
119
can never value a precious gift.
I don't buy it.
120
If you harm my mother again
121
no one will be able to save you
from me.
122
Hmmph!
123
(inaudible)
124
Good morning, Alap.
125
Hope you recognise me.
126
This is the Rudrabhairav.
127
How long will it take?
128
Um...
129
I'll do it.
130
I'll fix up a date.
131
Don't worry.
132
Confirm the show.
133
Yes.
134
The job will be done.
135
Okay.
136
Show? You're managing shows?
137
Hey, why are you lying?
I've been noticing you.
138
- I'm not...
- You haven't even been practising.
139
Don't avoid me.
Why are you lying?
140
Wait.
141
Turn off the lights.
142
The guards are not there.
143
- Come with me.
- Okay.
144
Come along.
145
Let's go.
Have you checked properly?
146
Wait.
147
Let me go first.
148
- Let's go.
- Come.
149
This way.
150
Hurry up.
151
This way.
Fast.
152
Where are you going?
153
Don't you dare try this again, Rohini.
154
Don't forget, your son's life
is in my hands.
155
Take her back.
156
- Come on!
- Come.
157
- Come.
- Let me go.
158
- Come on!
- Moti! Moti!
159
Hey, let me go!
160
Why are you here, Gopal?
161
Naad has returned to Anandagarh.
Why are you still here?
162
I was on my way.
163
I came here because of the ruckus.
164
Leave!
165
And keep a close eye on Naad.
166
- Go.
- Okay.
167
Who's putting these ideas
in your head, Moti?
168
Answer me.
169
No, it's just that...
170
She was in pain so...
171
How dare you?
172
Who should I punish for this?
173
You or your son?
174
Hmm?
175
Moti?
176
Punish me.
177
Hmm.
178
Alap.
179
- Hey.
- Hmm?
180
What's this?
181
Didn't sleep at all, did you?
182
I just can't crack this notation.
183
Even the rare books in your library
couldn't give me a hint.
184
What do I do now, Shruti?
185
I know you very well, Alap.
186
Tell me what's...
187
You evaded my questions yesterday too.
188
What are you hiding?
189
And...
190
stop avoiding me.
191
Has something happened
to Rohini Aunty?
192
Hey, why are you crying?
193
Alap?
194
Tell me what happened.
195
Is Rohini Aunty alright?
196
Hey...
197
What...
198
Moti.
199
W... Where's Moti?
200
Tell me.
201
Where's Moti?
202
Hey!
203
Wait!
204
Listen to me!
205
Moti...
206
How could you not tell me
something like this?
207
You could've at least told me
that Rohini Aunty is in danger.
208
Don't you trust me at all?
209
Mom will be fine, right, Shruti?
210
She'll be fine.
211
Nothing will happen to her.
212
We'll crack the notation together.
213
Hey...
214
can't we try searching
Grandpa's farmhouse?
215
Dad was saying
there might be rare books.
216
We might find something.
217
I can get the keys
if you want me to.
218
Okay.
219
Let's go.
220
Shruti.
221
- Don't tell anyone about Mom, please.
- I'll tell everyone.
222
Obviously I won't.
Come on.
223
This way.
224
Oh, sorry.
I can barely see anything.
225
- Shruti.
- Hmm?
226
There's nothing much here.
227
There's another room.
228
- Ouch!
- Hey! Careful.
229
A rudrabina.
230
Did your Grandpa teach
how to play the rudrabina?
231
I've never heard anything like that.
232
HAIL GODDESS SARASWATI
233
Mom's handwriting...
234
(inaudible)
235
What are you thinking about?
Look what I found.
236
There's a pen in the box.
237
See, it looks so strange.
238
Wait.
I didn't notice that.
239
Hey.
240
Isn't it the same symbol?
241
Yes, looks like it.
242
What does it have to do
with my grandpa?
243
Only one person can answer that.
