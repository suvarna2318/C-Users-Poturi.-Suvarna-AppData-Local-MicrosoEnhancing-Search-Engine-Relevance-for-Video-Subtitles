In the name of God, the most gracious, the most Merciful.
3
From Muhammad, the Messenger of God
4
to Heraclius, the emperor of Byzantium.
5
greetings to him who is the
follower of righteous guidance.
6
I bid you to hear the divine call.
7
I am the messenger of God to the people;
8
accept Islam for your salvation.
9
He speaks of a new prophet in Arabia.
10
Was it like this when John, the Baptist
came to king Herod
11
out of the desert, crying about salvation?
12
To Muqawqis, Patriarch of Alexandria.
13
Kisra, emperor of Persia.
14
Muhammad calls you with the call of God.
15
Accept Islam for your salvation...
16
embrace Islam.
17
You come out of the desert,
smelling of camel and goat.
18
To tell Persia where he should kneel?
19
Muhammad, Messenger of God.
20
Who gave him this authority?
21
God sent Muhammad
as a mercy to mankind.
22
The Scholars and Historians of Islam -
The University of Al-Azhar in Cairo
The High Islamic Congress of the Shiat in Lebanon
23
The makers of this film honour the Islamic tradition
which holds that the Impersonation of the Prophet
offends against the spirituality of his message.
24
Therefore, the person of Mohammad
will not be shown.
25
<i>600 years after Christ died,</i>
26
<i>when Europe was sunk in the dark ages</i>
27
<i>and everywhere the old
civilizations were falling,</i>
28
<i>Muhammad was born
in Mecca, in Arabia.</i>
29
<i>Mecca was then a rich trading
city, ruled by its merchants</i>
30
<i>whose wealth was multiplied
by a unique privilege...</i>
31
<i>they housed the gods.</i>
32
<i>Every year, at the
time of the great fair,</i>
33
<i>the desert priests brought their idols</i>
34
<i>and the images of their gods
into the custody of the Kaaba.</i>
35
<i>Once, the most holy shrine of Abraham,</i>
36
<i>the Kaaba had now
become a house of idolotry</i>
37
<i>hosting no fewer than
360 different gods.</i>
38
<i>Mecca in 610 A.D.</i>
39
Bilal!
40
Have you had today's count Umaya?
41
Not yet...
42
but this year the Gods are gold.
43
When you put the Gods and Prophet together,
you sit very pretty between hmm?
44
And more gods to place in the Kaaba.
45
Caravan from Syria.
46
- Hmm...they must have been running.
- They'll be thirsty.
47
Put five more men on north wells.
48
How many sheep shall
I have to kill for them?
49
70?
50
Give them a hundred.
51
Mecca must keep her
name for hospitality.
52
And ten lambs for the leaders.
53
Bread and water,
do the poets have in the Hakim's house?
54
Where verse and prose are
nightly put to slaughter.
55
And...and the bread, I swear in there,
56
is thinner than the water!
57
Oh...open the space, open the space,
you lovers of poetry,
58
to Abu Sufian, willing and which...
59
patron of the arts.
60
When Abu Sofyan invites the poet in,
61
their joy is kit and love is kin.
62
Where wines and cakes abound,
63
the skills of Abu Sofyan.
64
All revels and all songs begin,
65
when Abu Sofyan invites the poet in.
66
From the silkworms of China, my lady.
67
A pleasure to the limb...
68
and as my lady can see,
a ravish to the eye.
69
Yes, 7 lengths.
70
20 dinars.
71
Abu Sofyan's wife?
72
15.
73
Oh, gold! The gods of the
Kaaba have their needs,
74
their upkeeps.
75
Who is that man who stood there,
who looked into my soul?
76
Carry me away from here.
77
Why must Muhammad come down here?
78
Why don't you stop him?
79
He is your nephew.
80
Maybe he will change.
81
Change?
82
He is 40 years old.
83
It's unnatural...
84
with a rich wife, he could
afford the best of Mecca.
85
Yet he chooses to sit shivering in a cave.
86
It is unnatural!
87
For a man who dares to
risk the anger of Al-Uzza,
88
who keeps our health.
89
Manat, the god of our prosperity.
90
Allat, the god of our
family and tribes.
91
and Hubal...
92
Hubal, who starts our caravans
and predicts our fate.
93
To challenge the gods within earshot
of the gods is dangerous.
94
Unreasonable.
95
Rebellious, blasphemous.
96
Yes, I'm afraid Muhammad
will harm himself.
97
I am always sad
when the great fair is over.
98
I might not see the next one.
99
Abu Talib! Abu Talib!
100
Catch your breath, Zaid!
101
Has Muhammad come down
from Mount Hira yet?
102
He's been up there three days.
103
No, no, I haven't seen him.
104
Khadijah hoped he might have
come to you on his way home.
105
Then he's still up there.
106
Three days.
107
I'm afraid for him on the mountain,
108
because...
109
I don't know what it means.
110
<i>Men see the world too well
from a mountain.</i>
111
Muhammad! Read!
112
In the name of thy Lord who created
man from His sensitive drop of blood.
113
Who teaches man what he knows not.
114
Read!
115
He's still trembling under the blanket...
116
but he has spoken.
117
Zaid! What happened to
my nephew on the mountain?
118
He was alone, in the cave.
119
Suddenly, an angel came in to him.
120
The angel said: Read!
121
Muhammad replied: I can not read.
122
The angel commanded again: Read!
123
In the name of thy Lord,
124
who created man from
His sensitive drop of blood,
125
who teaches man what he knows not.
126
Read!
127
Who knows if it was Gabriel?
128
It could have been a dream.
129
When Muhammad was coming from
the mountain, he saw Gabriel plainly.
130
In the shape of a man
standing on the horizon.
131
Wherever he looked,
132
upon every turn of
his head he saw him.
133
And Gabriel said to him again,
134
I am Gabriel...
135
and you Muhammad,
136
are the Messenger of God.
137
Who has he told about this?
138
His wife,
139
and Ali,
140
and, his friend Abu Bakr.
141
And you?
142
I am his adopted son.
143
Be careful to whom you talk.
144
Tell him his uncle who protected him
when he was a child, will protect him still.
145
After all...
146
they say the God of Moses
147
spoke to him out of a burning bush.
148
If you do not restrain
your nephew then we will.
149
He's dividing the city,
heart against house.
150
He's dividing the generations
child against parent.
151
The young are listening to him.
152
He attracts the young.
153
We are Arabs,
we obey our fathers.
154
Our children cannot be our teachers.
155
How can we accept that the man
we met in the street yesterday
156
can be some God's Prophet today?
157
Dead bones can live again, he says
158
because He who created man
159
can also make man return
from the dead, he says!
160
The Gods might leave us and
give their benefits to another city.
161
Tell him...we will give him
authority, position,
162
and keys to the Kaaba,
163
and money, what money he wants.
164
Tell him, we will give
him anything he wants.
165
Muhammad, spare yourself
...and me.
166
Do not put a greater burden on
an old man that he can bear.
167
In your childhood, you were in my arms.
168
I cannot now see you hurt.
169
If you refuse them...
170
they will hurt you.
171
He said this to me:
172
Were they to put the sun in my
right hand and the moon in my left,
173
I would not renounce my message,
174
which is from God.
175
When I am dead,
you may do as you please,
176
but whilst I'm alive,
you will obey your father!
177
Why did you hurt our father?
178
If I were drunk every day
and played dice every night,
179
you'd call it high spirits!
180
You will be more my
brother than you are now!
181
You are all my children.
182
I've given you everything I could,
183
but it seems not to be enough.
184
Muhammad gives me more,
185
he give all the world more.
186
Get him out of here, father!
187
It's not Waleed or me,
it's our father.
188
You tortured him.
189
Wait Hudayfa, wait!
190
How can they say
it's an invention, Musab,
191
when it isn't new?
192
In Mecca, it's new.
193
Yet, God has said it all before...
194
to Noah, Moses, Jesus
to all the Prophets,
195
but people changed it,
turned it, forgot it.
196
Now God said it to Muhammad again...
197
and it is new again.
198
What is it?
199
It's Jafar.
200
What have you brought with you?
201
The very word of God.
202
When the sun is overthrown.
203
When the stars fall.
204
When the mountains vanish.
205
When the camels big with
young are abandoned.
206
When the wild beasts are herded together.
207
When the seas rise.
208
When the souls are sorted.
209
When the female infant
who is buried alive,
210
asks for what crime she was killed.
211
When the books are opened.
212
When the sky is torn away,
213
then...
214
every soul...
215
will know what it has done.
216
Were you there, Jafar
when God gave him these words?
217
Dawn is coming up.
218
Ammar, you first,
219
then you Jaafar.
220
Ammar!
221
You kept your mother awake
all night with worry.
222
I'm sorry father.
223
Where were you?
224
Have you been with Muhammad again?
225
What will happen now?
226
Forgive him, it was
my fault, I did it.
227
That God has helped us all our lives.
228
But it fell...
229
it could not even help itself.
230
What talk have you been listening to?
231
The real god is unseen.
232
He's not made of clay.
233
Ammar, we see the gods
in the Kaaba every day.
234
I'm afraid for you.
235
You're listening to people
who will hurt you.
236
I'm listening to Muhammad, mother.
237
Muhammad is generous, yes.
238
He gives, he shares,
239
he'll pass no man without a smile,
240
but he is spreading dangerous ideas.
241
Dangerous ideas,
that no man should start?
242
That the rich should not afloat the poor?
243
The strong should not oppress the weak?
244
Are these dangerous ideas?
245
Girls should not be forced into marriage,
246
but be able to choose or refuse.
247
By only tonight, he said;
248
Stop the burial of new-born girls.
249
I was fortunate, always
fortunate with your mother.
250
Yes, but you know that you and I
nearly never met, Yasser.
251
And you were nearly never born.
252
I was to be buried,
253
like my two sisters,
254
but my father couldn't do it.
255
He couldn't do it the third time.
256
When the second girl was being...
257
when my father was putting sand over her,
258
she took hold of his finger,
the way a baby does.
259
He told my mother afterwards,
260
that it was a minute...
261
before the tender little grip eased...
262
and he dared take away his hand.
263
When I was born,
264
my father ran out of the house
265
screaming that he couldn't do it again,
266
that he could never do it again.
267
Sumayyah, it is the custom.
268
But it's wrong.
269
The gods that let such
things be are no gods.
270
I promised to go to Muhammad's
house mama, we pray there.
271
Yes! He is a good man.
272
Yes...
yes, you go.
273
Two men are following him.
274
Read? Muhammad can
neither write nor read.
275
But he can speak.
276
What did you say?
277
He can speak?
278
Well, so can you so now,
you speak up young man.
279
What does Muhammad say, umm?
280
They are God's words, not his.
281
Which god's?
282
What words?
283
A speaking god?
284
Your Muhammad
speaks only to himself.
285
When God reveals His
message to Muhammad,
286
he remembers every word
287
then he tells it to those who can write...
288
this is the Quran.
289
Muhammad has starved
himself into dreams.
290
He hides under a blanket
with his eyes shut.
291
His eyes are shut
but his heart is open.
292
You! Kick him for his cleverness.
293
There is no purpose in that.
294
Doesn't Muhammad realize, we
live by giving housing to the gods?
295
We own the Kaaba.
296
Every year, the tribes of
Arabia come here to Mecca
297
to pray and to buy from us.
298
Now, were we to replace
300 Gods with just one?
299
Whom we cannot even see, who is
supposed to be in Taif and Medina,
300
here in my house,
301
in Jerusalem, on the moon?
302
Where would Mecca be then?
303
The gods are both our
worship and our revenue.
304
You cannot buy and sell God.
305
Young man, you are
close to the whip.
306
Ammar, be sensible boy.
307
I have a question.
308
Muhammad teaches you,
a slave is equal to his master.
309
This black Bilal, who I
paid money for...equal to me?
310
Yes Muhammad says...
311
before God, all men are as
equal as the teeth of a comb.
312
This is a very pleasant idea
to slaves and beggars.
313
It gives them pretensions.
314
Bilal!
315
Teach this man the difference
between the Lord of Mecca and a slave.
316
Take that whip.
317
Lash his face, to
teach his mouth a lesson.
318
Whip him!
319
Whip him!
320
Cut him!
321
Whip him!
322
Do it Bilal!
323
Obey them!
324
They will kill you!
325
See what anarchy they bring!
326
They've even infected our slaves!
327
If you're human enough
to have gods...
328
...remember!
329
They are the gods of your owner!
330
I bought your humanity Bilal
when I bought you.
331
You will be corrected!
332
One, one God.
333
There is only one God!
334
Who is stronger now?
335
Your master
or this one god of yours?
336
One God.
337
There is only one God.
338
Bring the stones!
339
One God.
340
One...
341
...one God.
342
Crush him!
343
Break him!
344
Have you finished with him?
345
There is only one God!
346
- <i>One God!</i>
- You could swear the slave was preaching!
347
- <i>One God!</i>
- Lord Umaya!
348
Abu Bakr will pay a 100
dinars for this slave.
349
Wait now!
350
It's against our social order
to sell a slave during his correction.
351
The offer is to Lord Umaya!
352
200!
353
If the price of slaves is raised,
354
we shall have to bail
ourselves next year.
355
Take him!
356
He is no use to me anymore!
357
Kill him or take him,
I'm finished with him!
358
We are declaring ourselves.
359
God has told his messenger
to declare Islam to all men!
360
Open the windows!
361
Let the world hear!
362
We are coming out of the darkness!
363
Hear well the word of God!
Hear well the messenger of God!
364
There are no other gods but God
and Muhammad is his messenger.
365
There are no other gods but God
and Muhammad is his messenger.
366
We have come into light,
367
join us in the march to the Kaaba!
368
God is most great,
God is most great!
369
God has no partner!
370
We have come into light,
371
join us in the march to the Kaaba!
372
Muhammad and his rebellion
called Islam are coming out,
373
to foul our gods
and dethrone religion.
374
Don't let them reach the Kaaba!
375
Throw them back! Defend your gods!!
376
There is no god but God
and Muhammad is the messenger of God.
377
There is no god but God
and Muhammad is the messenger of God.
378
There is no god but God
and Muhammad is the messenger of God.
379
Protect the prophet!
380
There is no god but God
and Muhammad is the messenger of God.
381
Guards!
382
God is great!
383
This is blasphemy you idiot!
384
God is great!
385
God is great!
386
God is great!
387
There is no god but God
and Muhammad is the messenger of God.
388
Now's the time to break them,
there are only 30 of them.
389
No, we've done enough.
390
More will only create sympathy for them.
391
God is great!
392
<i>Stand down!</i>
God is great!
393
God is great!
394
In the name of God,
most gracious, most merciful.
395
Say: O you who reject faith,
396
I worship not what you worship.
397
<i>Keep him out of the Kaaba!</i>
I worship not what you worship.
398
<i>Keep him out of the Kaaba!</i>
399
<i>Lead them out!</i>
400
Neither do you worship what i worship.
<i>Lead them out!</i>
401
Neither do you worship what i worship.
402
Silence, you're a false prophet!
Neither do you worship what i worship.
403
Silence, you're a false prophet!
404
Finish Muhammad!
405
Protect the prophet!
Finish Muhammad!
406
Protect the prophet!
407
Messenger of God,
back to the corner!
408
Hamza! Hamza!
409
You are brave.
410
He is the bravest man in the desert...
411
when he meets unarmed men.
412
Muhammad is...is a liar!
413
Liar?
414
If you don't let him speak!
415
Where's the lie and where's the truth...
416
when it hasn't been spoken yet?
417
Muhammad is a fraud!
418
Stand up! Hit me back if you dare!
419
I affirm my nephew's religion
and I say what he says!
420
Whoever has the courage to fight,
fight with me!
421
Muhammad, when I hunt the desert at night...
422
I know God...
is not kept in a house.
423
Who would have thought that Hamza,
424
Hamza above all,
425
with his wine drinking, lion hunting...
426
would come to join Muhammad?
427
The more we attack him,
more they seem to join him.
428
Where does he find his words?
429
I don't know.
430
How can an illiterate man
go up on a mountain
431
and come down three days later,
blazing with poetry?
432
If it were just poetry...
433
he says it's God.
434
How do we fight someone whose
strength we do not understand?
435
Muhammad promises heaven,
trees in the skies.
436
So naturally he's found an audience.
437
Then we must make that audience
less eager to listen to him.
438
We will begin with the weaker ones.
439
Your turn!
440
Have mercy!
441
Stretch her!
442
Who is your God?
Answer me!
443
Say it!
444
Say Hubal is your God!
445
Say it!
446
There is only one God
447
and Muhammad is the messenger of God!
448
Oh my god!
449
Ammar!
450
Your father and mother
are the first martyrs of Islam!
451
You are promised paradise!
452
How much are you men prepared to suffer?
453
The Prophet has said we must leave Mecca.
454
If you stay,
455
they will kill you...
456
one by one.
457
Muhammad says that in Abyssinia,
there is a Christian King.
458
No man is wronged in his country.
459
We must leave now, today.
460
Uthman!
461
God be praised!
462
Let us go.
463
We found their tracks
and followed them,
464
but they just disappeared!
465
They were there...
in the desert, under the vultures
466
and you let them escape you!
467
Escape? They vanished!
468
If Muhammad has stayed,
then only the weakest have gone.
469
Weak or strong,
they'll blacken our name.
470
We're honest merchants,
we buy and sell in good faith.
471
We cannot afford scandal.
472
Abyssinia...
473
Amr!
474
You are a friend of Annajashi, the king?
475
Yes.
476
Can you use that friendship?
477
I think I can bring them back...
478
yes.
479
Abyssinia...
480
Rise up Amr.
481
Please, nothing you may ask
for that we will not give.
482
Lion of Judah, I...
483
I don't know where to begin.
484
You have our friendship,
485
begin there.
486
Certain runaway slaves have escaped
from us into your kingdom.
487
Slaves go back, as you no doubt
would returned our slaves to us.
488
There are however some
free men among them...
489
rebels.
490
Rebels?
491
Disturbance in Arabia,
why am I not informed?
492
They are rebels in religion.
493
At one time or another,
all religions were rebellions.
494
The bodies of slaves of the world
and beaten are disposal.
495
But as Jesus Christ as our shepherd,
496
the souls of men are his sheep.
497
These are Arabs who have betrayed
the religion of their fathers.
498
They follow a lunatic
they call...a Prophet.
499
But I cannot put souls into
chains without hearing them.
500
Good, they're stiff
next we'll hang them.
501
Do you not bow to yourself
before your prophet?
502
Muhammad is a man,
503
we kneel only to God.
504
Where are Muhammad's miracles, Jafar?
505
If he were a prophet,
he'd light the sky with miracles
506
Indeed, this is true.
507
God has given his prophets
the signs of miracles
508
that we may recognize them.
509
The miracle of Muhammad
is the Holy Quran.
510
A book! A book!
511
Written by an illiterate,
attributed to God.
512
I think the emperor has had enough!
513
I'm mindful of petty costs.
514
When God set down tongues of fire
upon the heads of Christ's apostles,
515
so they could speak the
many languages of the world
516
that they knew not before.
517
But do such miracles happen in our times?
518
I've heard enough!
You've made a poor case.
519
When we suffered persecution in Mecca,
520
Muhammad told us,
go to Abyssinia,
521
the land of the righteous king,
where no man is wronged!
522
What they call persecution
was fair punishment,
523
that is order, now...
524
Why did your prophet send you to me?
525
Because you believe in the book
of the one God as we do.
526
He sent us because in your heart,
God will protect us.
527
Talking with him is like
drawing water from a mirage.
528
But they've now belay that duty on
me to listen to them, my friend.
529
Go on!
530
For years, we worshiped
wood and stone,
531
images of our own manufacture.
532
We lived in ignorance of God.
533
We had few earthly laws
and no heavenly laws.
534
The rich neglect the poor.
535
And the natural pity of man,
536
whereby he lifts his brother
up when he has fallen...
537
is described by them as
upsetting social order!
538
To this inhumanity,
has come a man...
539
whom God chose...
540
and in that we believe.
541
You've overcome, I beg
you to collect yourself.
542
I speak of the messenger of God.
543
Muhammad teaches us
to worship one god,
544
to speak truth,
545
to love our neighbors as ourselves,
546
to give charity,
even a smile can be charity.
547
To protect women from misuse,
548
to shelter orphans...
549
and to turn away from
gods of wood and stone!
550
I cannot keep still and
hear this blasphemy!
551
We are an ancient civilization...
552
to call our gods wood and stone
is to speak ignorantly of them.
553
The idol...the form,
is not what we worship,
554
but the spirit that resides within the form.
555
I agree that idolatry is not
always fully understood.
556
Thank you.
557
Now let me bring him back to the women.
558
God made woman to be the
proper companion of man.
559
She is different but equal.
560
Equal?!
561
We buy them.
562
Feed them, clothe them,
563
use them, discard them...
564
women equal to us?
565
God created man from
one male and one female.
566
Amr, you must respect in all
woman the womb that bore you.
567
Why are your 300
guards so tongue-tied?
568
While this only guard is eloquent.
569
God has spoken to us before...
570
through Abraham, Noah, Moses
and through Jesus Christ.
571
Why should we be so surprised that God
speaks to us now through Muhammad?
572
Who taught you those names?
573
They are named in the Quran.
574
I knew Muhammad when he
was an orphan minding sheep!
575
And we knew Christ as a carpenter.
576
What Christ says
and what your Muhammad says
577
is like two raised from the same land.
578
They are lying to you,
they deny Christ.
579
You worship three gods, they say.
Father, Son and Holy Ghost, they say.
580
What do you say of Christ?
581
They say God cannot have a son.
582
Christ is not the Son of God.
583
Speak to me of Christ.
584
We say of Christ what
our prophet has taught us...
585
that God cast his holy spirit into
the womb of a virgin named, Mary
586
and that she conceived
Christ, the Apostle of God.
587
The Apostle he says,
not the son, not the son!
588
What does your miracle, your Quran,
say of the birth of our dear Lord Jesus Christ?
589
May I relate the words?
590
Come closer to me.
591
In the name of God,
most gracious, most merciful.
592
Relate in the book, the story of Mary.
593
How she withdrew from her
family to a place in the east.
594
How we sent to her our
angel, Gabriel, who said:
595
''I am a messenger from your God"
596
"to announce the birth
of a holy son to you."
597
She said: "How shall I, Mary, have a son
when no man has touched me?''
598
And Gabriel replied:
599
"For your Lord says, it will happen."
600
We appoint him as a sign onto man...
601
and a mercy from us.
602
It is a thing ordained.
603
The difference between us and you,
604
is not bigger than this line.
605
Not for a mountain of gold
will I give them up to you.
606
You may live in Abyssinia, in peace,
607
for as long as you wish.
608
May God's blessings be upon you,
609
when you return.
610
lntolerable!
611
Mohamed disturbs even
our foreign alliances!
612
Very well!
613
We will make a foreigner of him!
614
Abu Talib,
615
has his arms around him.
616
Very well!
617
We will throw uncle
and nephew out.
618
In one bundle, his whole family out.
619
We will expel them from ourselves.
620
No merchant may trade with them.
621
No land remain to them.
622
No roof shelter them.
623
No beggar beg for them.
624
No woman marry them.
625
Until they renounce, they can't.
626
<i>These were the worst
years of Muhammad's life.</i>
627
<i>For three years they suffered the hunger,
thirst, cruelty of the open desert.</i>
628
<i>But the year of grief was still to come,</i>
629
<i>when Khadija, Muhammad's
wife for 24 years, died.</i>
630
<i>When Abu Talib,
his old Protector, died...</i>
631
<i>with his last breath, Abu Talib,</i>
632
<i>tried again to reconcile
Mecca and Muhammad.</i>
633
He never asked more from you...
634
...than one word.
635
One...
636
one God.
637
If it were only a question of one word,
we would have given him ten words.
638
But the word he wants,
would dethrone all the gods.
639
You were afraid even to hear him.
640
<i>With the death of his uncle,
Muhammad has now lost all protection.</i>
641
<i>He was no longer safe in Mecca.</i>
642
<i>Alone with Zaid, his adopted son,
he went to the hillside town of Taif.</i>
643
<i>He asked to be taken in,
to be allowed to preach.</i>
644
<i>But the children of
Taif were turned loose,</i>
645
<i>to stone him back into the desert.</i>
646
What are you doing?!
647
Stop! Stop!
648
Leave him alone! Go away!
649
<i>Muhammad called this,
the bitterest day of his life.</i>
650
<i>Then miraculously,</i>
651
<i>when Muhammad's mission
seemed to have failed,</i>
652
<i>his entire situation changed.</i>
653
<i>A deputation from the rich,
but self-destroying city of Medina,</i>
654
<i>met him by night at
the rocks of Aqaba,</i>
655
<i>asking him to come to them,</i>
656
<i>to stand between their factions,</i>
657
<i>to mediate their continual
quarrels and civil wars.</i>
658
<i>Muhammad agreed...</i>
659
<i>provided they gave him a pledge</i>
660
<i>that they worship the one God only.</i>
661
Wait!
662
When we take this pledge we expel
ourselves from the rest of Arabia.
663
So, wait!
664
War is in this pledge.
665
We are to make
enemies of brothers.
666
We are to make
firewood of our gods!
667
That is the meaning of the pledge.
668
If we take it, there can
be no turning back...
669
for Muhammad is indeed
the messenger of God,
670
foretold to us by
the Jews in our city.
671
So if anyone has doubt
in this pledge, go now.
672
And if you have no doubts,
then you do as I do.
673
I pledge myself to
the one and only God,
674
and to you Muhammad,
the messenger of God.
675
He is of us and we are of him.
676
Let him bring his followers,
our brothers, to us, to Medina.
677

<i>This was a journey
that changed the world.</i>
679
<i>The Hijra, or Flight to Medina.</i>
680
<i>Only 70 people</i>
681
<i>split up into small groups,</i>
682
<i>walking 250 miles of desert.</i>
683
<i>Yet, so profound were the consequences,</i>
684
<i>so lasting were the effects of this walk</i>
685
<i>that from it the muslims
date their calendar.</i>
686
<i>In this moment, Islam found it's future.</i>
687
<i>Muhammad himself stayed in
Mecca, in the greatest danger</i>
688
<i>until all his followers had left safely.</i>
689
Muhammad has become a nation,
690
he has received a city,
691
entering into pledges and treaties
692
and you, Salool, who claim
to be king of Medina
693
lost the kingdom last night
while you were in bed!
694
You should worry about
yourself, Abu Sufian.
695
Every time you trade a
whiff of perfume out the city,
696
you must creep past
that man in Medina.
697
He is across your
mercantile throat so to speak.
698
And what do you intend to do?
699
l intend to wait.
700
And how long will you wait?
701
Till you and the rest of Arabia remove him,
702
to save your way of life.
703
And while you wait?
704
I should accept his call of course.
705
Does he think I will
give him my birthright?
706
I will not.
707
Medina is worth the conversion.
708
Hypocrisy.
709
Of course it's...a healthy hypocrisy.
710
King Salool,
711
wiping his face on the floor
5 times a day praying?
712
I don't believe you.
713
He may not have to.
714
We'll do know what we
should have done before:
715
kill Muhammad.
716
Come, come and see.
717
They say that practice
leads to perfection.
718
7 young men each
from a different family,
719
my own son Ikrima is with them.
720
They will stab him together.
721
If the responsibility for his death
is shared, where lies the guilt?
722
My idea.
723
I'm not sure I'm part of it.
724
Muhammad's body contains too much...
725
his mind, his words...
726
But it is an ingenious solution.
727
And a final one.
728
No!
729
Ali, his cousin, laid there to die for him?
730
Who are we fighting?
731
They cannot go far, all
the tracks are watched.
732
He must take to the desert.
733
Bakkah will give
100 camels to the man
734
who brings back Muhammad...
735
...or his head!
736
Look for 3 of them:
737
Muhammad,
738
Abu Bakr,
739
and Uriqat, his Bedouin guide.
740
What is it?
741
They're not grazing camel.
742
Maybe two days, that from the city.
743
Why are you here?
744
Medina is to the north.
745
They make the tracks, not I.
746
Nomads? Travelling west?
747
I know my art.
748
They say that you can track
a bird by smelling the air.
749
We go with them.
750
He may be in that cave over there.
751
Muhammad, if you come out,
we will take you to Mecca alive.
752
Muhammad, come out!
753
They can't be in there,
this...this web is unbroken.
754
And these pigeons,
they would not build.
755
We were wrong to follow them
we should have gone north.
756
Let's move then.
757
We still have time to head them off.
758
<i>A few threads of a spider's web</i>
759
<i>were all that was then between
Muhammad and murder.</i>
760
<i>But he was a man not to be killed.</i>
761
<i>The Bedouin guide led him and his
companion, Abu Bakr, in their escape</i>
762
<i>through untracked spaces of the desert
and the heat of the June days.</i>
763
<i>At Medina, his followers
waited with their welcome ready</i>
764
<i>but in great fear for his journey.</i>
765
Anything?
766
No, nothing.
767
He himself says he is only a man.
768
No man can survive that heat.
769
- There! I see them!
- Look!
770
Run and hide.
771
I may be obliged
to free you as a gesture.
772
Welcome to the city
of Medina, the blessed.
773
Your city, messenger of God.
774
You will stay with me,
messenger of God.
775
I have the best house in Medina.
776
You will give me the
honor of keeping you.
777
Stay with me!
778
Please! Please! Please!
779
How can the Prophet choose
between so many welcomes?
780
Where God guides his camel to stop,
there he will build his house.
781
All agreed?
782
We turn Quaswa, his camel loose
783
and where Quaswa sits, the Prophet stays.
784
Clever man.
785
A choice made by a
camel can offend no one.
786
Here we will build
the house of the Prophet.
787
And our first meeting
place, a prayer house!
788
The first mosque of Islam, here!
789
God is great! God is great!
790
What is the prophet of God doing?
791
Carrying bricks?
792
Give me that.
793
Look, you are doing too much.
794
Please, go and sit down
...we'll do it.
795
Look! He went for more.
796
"Work is a worship" he says.
797
He's 53 years old.
798
How old are you?
799
There is something missing.
800
Maybe a bell to call the people in.
801
- The Christians use a bell?
- Mmm (yes).
802
What about a horn, like the Jews?
803
A drum?
804
There's too much blood in a drum.
805
Why not the human voice...
806
as in Umar ibn Khattab's vision?
807
The Prophet agrees?
808
He means you, Bilal.
809
Me?
810
You have a good voice, use it.
811
Climb up there.
812
Brothers!
813
Today, a man of Medina,
814
will embrace a man of Mecca.
815
Each will share half and half.
816
Reach out, embrace your
neighbor and brother.
817
I'm tired of the politics of
kissing slaves, read this!
818
The prophet should concern
himself with the after-world.
819
How is my son?
820
Praying like a horse.
821
Does it burn your hands?
822
If it's not torn up,
it will burn down the house.
823
He's making laws like a king.
824
He has declared that loyalty to Islam
is more than loyalty to tribal family.
825
What?
826
All muslims are next of kin to one-another?
827
Don't be mislead by that.
828
They must change the
nature of the tribes before that.
829
The danger is here, equality:
830
a man's neighbour is as good as himself.
831
The lunatic means it!
832
Jews and Christians have
equal rights with Muslims.
833
The Jews who attach themselves to a
common wealth shall be protected.
834
- Women have rights of inheritance?
- Rights.
835
Next, he'll be giving the camel rights.
836
He has! The lunatic has!
You can't overload them.
837
He's remaking a city, my city!
838
Damn him!
839
He's taken our sons from us,
our future from us.
840
His rights... are wrongs!
841
No more.
842
This time... it will
not be just his riffraff.
843
We will take everything of
value they have left in Mecca.
844
Their rugs, their houses, their silver...
845
and with it, a large of caravan to Damascus.
846
My friends, listen to me!
847
I have news from Mecca!
848
Everything you have left behind is gone!
849
The thieves!
850
Abu Bakr's shops,
the prophet's house... sold!
851
Every cup or piece of cloth,
852
every rag or bone you ever
owned is thrown on the market.
853
You are a people of nothing.
854
Don't you even fight for what you own?
855
Who talks of the fight?
856
What other way is there, Hamza?
857
When the Prophet
says fight, we fight.
858
Now he says, peace.
859
Exactly!
860
You are a peace loving people!
861
Up to your necks and fore-bearers.
862
Go back to work.
863
We have to defend ourselves.
864
You are the messenger of God.
865
Yet, they mock...
866
abuse and plunder us
and we do nothing.
867
In the package of war, we are pathetic!
868
But they are led by greed.
869
We are led by God
...and you.
870
Now I...
871
I know how you hate the sword,
872
but we have to fight.
873
They have stolen our property.
874
They are taking it to Damascus,
right past our own door.
875
I say by God, get back!
876
I'm sorry I'm carried away.
877
It's the pounding in my head.
878
Please... fight them!
879
But... look at the sun.
880
It's not the time for prayer.
881
It is newly revealed
by God to his messenger.
882
Fight, but fight in the way of God,
against those who fight against you.
883
Drive them out of the places
where they drove you out,
884
for persecution is worse than slaughter.
885
Fight them until persecution is no more
886
and religion is for God.
887
But if they stop,
888
let there be no more war...
889
for God never loves
the starter of wars.
890
So, fight in the way of God
891
against those who fight against you!
892
- God is great!
- God is great!! God is great!!
893
- God is great!
- God is great!!
894
These are the disciplines
the Prophet puts upon you.
895
You may not harm a woman,
a child or any old person!
896
You may not harm cripples!
897
You may not harm the
man that works in the field!
898
You may not cut down trees!
899
Strike only at those who have expelled you!
900
Who have stolen your rights and
riched themselves with your possessions!
901
Now, to the wells of Badr!
902
News from Medina!
903
Arm... arm yourselves!
Arm yourselves!
904
Defend your wealth!
905
Muhammad has come out of Medina
to attack the great caravan!
906
- How many men?
- Three hundred, two horses.
907
We man a 100 horses.
How many camels?
908
- Seventy.
- We'll bring a hundred and seventy!
909
And load twenty of my camels
with wine, we'll make a feast of it.
910
This is a war I'd like to fight,
911
a war we cannot lose!
912
Ride to Abu Sofyan's caravan,
tell him to turn towards Badr.
913
We will join our forces
tomorrow at the wells of Badr.
914
The wells of Badr, here.
915
Muhammad's march, here.
916
My charge of the caravan, here.
917
One day's march...
918
meet them at the wells.
919
I don't like it.
920
There is too much of Mecca
in my caravan to be risked.
921
Put out the fires!
Hold the camels!
922
We are turning west,
away from the wells.
923
Away?
You can't!
924
You must meet them at Badr.
925
We can drink them down like raw eggs.
926
If I run all night, I'll be out of
Muhammad's reach by morning.
927
Where is your honor, Abu Sofyan?!
928
Honor?
929
My honor is on the
backs of my camels.
930
Yes, I run...
931
Muhammad has occupied the wells!
932
He has moved directly
into our line of march.
933
Abu Sofyan has broken camp.
He's moving west, away from Badr.
934
The caravan is safe.
935
So, there is no need to fight.
936
Not fight?
937
If we fight, we will start
blood feuds between brothers.
938
Between father and son, you mean.
939
Hudayfa, your own son is with them,
he should have been whipped.
940
Mecca is greater than your family!
941
Waleed, your second son,
he is your true blood.
942
I say: fight!
943
We stand in the present
let the future look after itself.
944
Otba is not a coward.
945
We finish them tomorrow.
946
- We fight!
- We fight!!!
947
Are you finished?!
948
Form ranks, battle positions!
949
Each man to his own place!
950
Go back to your columns!
951
Move away... move back!
952
So Muhammad's filled the wells.
953
Now everyone brought here
will have to fight, for theirs.
954
Good, we fight!
955
Brothers, we hold the wells.
956
We stand in the name of
God and his messenger.
957
We wait.
958
Send us your champions!
959
(BATTLE OF BADR)
960
Who are you?!
961
We expect our peers
and our equals!
962
Come back!
963
My brother, Shaiba!
964
My son, Waleed!
965
And myself!
966
Not you.
967
Ubaida and I...
968
and Ali.
969
Are we your equals?
970
There is only one God
971
and Muhammad is His messenger.
972
Archers! Advance!
973
Archers!
974
Hold...
975
stretch!
976
Stretch!
977
Stretch!
978
Archers!
979
Archers back!
980
They are regrouping.
981
Forward!!
982
Ready!
983
Lancers!
984
God is great!
985
Archers!
986
God is great! God is great!
987
Umaya!
988
Umaya!
989
Bilal!
990
God is great!
991
Onward to victory!
992
God is great!
993
The Prophet has seen you!
994
You are not to rope
or drag the prisoners!
995
- They would've roped us!
- Cut them loose!
996
I said, cut them loose!
997
And give them water
998
And share your food,
equal mouth-fulls.
999
And if they walk, walk beside them.
1000
Any prisoner who can teach
10 Muslims to read... will go free.
1001
Why don't they go away?
1002
Because, they blame me Hind,
for whatever reason, good or bad.
1003
I should have joined them and
drown at the wells of Badr with them...
1004
but I saved the caravan
and our future with it.
1005
Why sing at me!
1006
Why sing my father and
my brother as it's not me?!
1007
Do you think I
need you to remind me?
1008
Muhammad, Ali, Hamza!
1009
With my nails, Hamza,
1010
I will give you measure for
measure, with my nails...
1011
killer, cut throat, butcher!
1012
Murdering beast!
1013
You slaughtered my father!
1014
Hamza!
1015
I will hunt... a lion hunter!
1016
I will make Hamza,
a running lion, my prey.
1017
And when you are dead Hamza,
I will cut your heart out,
1018
taste your blood,
cut you into pieces!
1019
I forbit this wailing.
it cannot go on.
1020
What we should do, we will do.
1021
We will call in our allies,
raise a new army against them.
1022
This time, we will
prepare it and plan it.
1023
Hamza!
1024
Come to prayer!
1025
Come to prayer!
1026
Come to victory!
1027
Come to victory!
1028
God is great!
1029
There is no god, but God!
1030
Is it a plague?
1031
What kind of an upside down
town have we come in to?
1032
You could fill your
pockets very nicely here.
1033
No merchant is minding his shop.
1034
God is minding the shop.
1035
- Where do you come from?
- Yemen.
1036
Did you stop in Mecca?
1037
It is on the road.
1038
You didn't answer my question,
1039
did you stop in Mecca?
1040
Long enough to rest my camels.
1041
Camels rest better in Mecca
than anywhere in the world.
1042
Yes.
1043
What is the word on the desert?
1044
Oh... it is bad for you.
1045
They are gathering..
1046
every young man with a
sword is on his way to Mecca.
1047
Our strength is here.
1048
Do not underestimate them.
1049
They are summoning up their courage.
1050
In Mecca there is music in every house.
1051
An Abyssinian slave, watch him.
He is good, he is vicious, watch him
1052
I will free you,
1053
give you your weight in silver,
1054
and your height in silk,
1055
for one throw like this.
1056
So they have come at last.
1057
We'll know how many soon enough.
1058
It's a big army.
1059
Three thousand men,
hundreds of horses.
1060
We beat them at Badr.
1061
That was a year ago.
1062
They have come to revenge Badr.
1063
Go home and get your swords.
1064
Soldiers of Mecca!
1065
Blood master blood!
1066
Avenge the dead of Badr!
1067
(BATTLE OF UHUD)
1068
There, Hamza, can you see him?
1069
He is your fortune.
1070
Ubada!
1071
Those horsemen on the flank out there,
1072
they're oddly placed.
1073
- They are under Khalid.
- Khalid?
1074
I often thought of that young man.
1075
Hamza!
1076
Yes?
1077
The Prophet asks if you
have noticed those horsemen?
1078
Yes I have.
1079
I don't like them.
1080
He's sending out 50
archers to watch them.
1081
No matter what happens,
the archers must hold off those horsemen.
1082
Zaid, tell the Prophet we are ready.
1083
What do you think, Hamza?
1084
Well they outnumber us,
so I'd say it's a fair fight.
1085
We see them
and they see us.
1086
What faces me has never frightened me.
1087
- All praise be to Hubal!
- Hubal!!
1088
When Muhammad gives the word...
1089
we will go to them.
1090
Hamza!
1091
Weapons ready!
1092
We march... now!
1093
Attack!!
1094
They've killed Hamza!
1095
On to them!
1096
You, take this! Fight back!
1097
Where are you going?!
1098
Fight! Fight!
1099
Fight back!
1100
This is a moment of victory!
1101
They're running away
from us, let's get the loot!
1102
Stand where you are told to stand!
1103
Come back to your positions!
1104
All of you, come back!
1105
It's a road!
1106
Our centre is gone!
1107
We've lost the battle, Khalid!
1108
Not yet.
1109
Hold on!
1110
Where is the prophet?
1111
Muhammad is dead,
I saw him fall!
1112
No, no! He's alive! Find him!
1113
Back, back to the mountains!
1114
Halt!
1115
I thought we were beaten!
1116
Now, victory is yours, Khalid.
1117
We have no victory until
we have finished Muhammad.
1118
He is up in those rocks.
1119
We have finished our business,
we have avenged Badr.
1120
But we can end him and Islam forever.
1121
Some of his fanatics are still with him.
1122
They have the
advantage of the mountains,
1123
the risk is too high.
1124
Muhammad, listen!
1125
A day for a day!
1126
The day of Uhub
for the day of Badr!
1127
Our dead have answered to your dead!
1128
Our dead are in paradise,
your dead are in hell fire!
1129
Hamza... Hamza!
1130
Do you hear me, Hamza?
1131
Do you know that
I am with you, I, Hind!
1132
Do you remember anything, Hamza?
1133
How you killed my
father and my brother?!
1134
Now you too are dead!
1135
My heart is light!
Do you hear, Hamza? Light!
1136
But I haven't finished with you!
1137
Death is too small.
1138
Wahshi, cut him open, cut him!
1139
They lost a battle
and what do they do?
1140
They come home and
dig the ground harder.
1141
- They're mad.
- I agree with you!
1142
They defy reason,
they are even happy they lost!
1143
God sent their defeat they say,
to try them in their faith.
1144
Oh yes! They are
fighting with the sky.
1145
They'll get what they want.
1146
They want Mecca.
1147
They'll get Mecca.
1148
When we see the stars at noon...
1149
Don't underestimate them,
I've learned that to my cost.
1150
My friend, Mecca is
more than their home.
1151
It's where God spoke to man.
1152
Mecca is like a...
homesickness to the soul.
1153
This year they're going as pilgrims.
1154
What?!
1155
Unarmed.
1156
Unarmed?
1157
Abu Sofyan will slaughter
them in the desert.
1158
If you believe in God as they do,
1159
it might be possible
not to get slaughtered.
1160
But I agree with you,
they probably will be.
1161
Be still!
1162
Do not let them provoke you,
that is what they want!
1163
Stand firm!
1164
Peace be to you.
1165
The Prophet says: All who love God
1166
must renew their oaths to him.
1167
Under the tree!
1168
They've sent someone else.
1169
It's Suheil!
1170
That means we might
come to an agreement.
1171
Muhammad, you have been
given conditions of truce
1172
between yourself and Mecca.
1173
Have you agreed to them yet?
1174
What is this?
1175
In the name of God, the most gracious...
1176
Who is this new God
they call, gracious?
1177
I do not know him,
strike him out.
1178
And I cannot agree with this...
1179
"Muhammad, the messenger of God?"
1180
If I have thought you
were the messenger of God,
1181
I would not have fought you.
1182
Make it, "Muhammad, the son of Abdullah
agrees with Suhayl, the son of Amr."
1183
That is more factual.
1184
Well, so I understand.
1185
Good, that is better.
1186
Now, it is agreed...
1187
that you do not
continue your pilgrimage,
1188
you must turn around and go home.
1189
Mecca is home.
1190
However...
1191
you may continue your
pilgrimage next year,
1192
and for 3 days only,
1193
in and out.
1194
We also agree to the
truce, for 10 years.
1195
During that time,
1196
you will not attack any tribe,
1197
or ambush any caravan,
1198
or any individual associated
with us and vice versa.
1199
If you injure any one
of us, the truce ends...
1200
...and vice versa.
1201
Is that clear?
1202
Ten years, ten years of peace.
1203
We need that time.
1204
We will use that time.
1205
These letters, from Muhammad,
messenger of God,
1206
to the rulers of the world...
1207
...call the world to Islam!
1208
To Heraclius, Emperor of Byzantium,
1209
Kisra, Emperor of Persia,
1210
Muqawqis, Patriarch of Alexandria.
1211
God go with you!
1212
God is great! God is great! God is great!
1213
There are no different races in Islam.
1214
An Arab is not superior to a foreigner.
1215
Nor a white man superior to a black.
1216
All return equally to God.
1217
Unless you desire for your neighbour,
what you desire for yourself...
1218
...you don't have faith.
1219
A man goes to bed with his belly full,
while his neighbor is hungry...
1220
...he isn't a Muslim.
1221
The Ink of a scholar is holier
than the blood of a martyr.
1222
A man reading is handsome
in the sight of God.
1223
So, learn to read.
1224
And when you have learned...
1225
...teach!
1226
The people of the book,
1227
the Jews with their Bible,
the Christians with their testament,
1228
must be respected by you.
1229
For their books likewise
came from God.
1230
You must not think of
Muhammad as more than a man.
1231
He was collecting firewood one day.
1232
"Let me do it," I said.
1233
"Why?" he said.
1234
"You are the prophet of God!"
1235
"You can't go around
scratching for firewood."
1236
But he looked at me, mumbling,
1237
"God does not like the man who considers
himself above other men," he said.
1238
So, I laid back and watched him.
1239
Suddenly, he stopped.
1240
He stood to his full
height and came to me.
1241
"Yes, I am the prophet of God," he said.
1242
"But even I do not know
what will become of me."
1243
Amr, have you come to take me again?
1244
No.
1245
I have come to ask you to take me.
1246
I witness that there is only one God,
1247
and that Muhammad is His messenger.
1248
May God forgive me the times
I have fought against you.
1249
Islam does away with
all that went before it.
1250
I'm sorry, I came in here wearing...
1251
Here are my jewels.
1252
What they are worth...
1253
...I give to the poor.
1254
- And may I offer you my...
- Yes.
1255
But you were the
bitterest sword against Islam.
1256
Now by the will of God...
1257
...I will be the raised sword of God.
1258
Ah, its all easy to God.
1259
Just as he makes dying living,
he can make losing winning.
1260
Two years ago we thought we were
beaten when we had to sign that truce.
1261
Look at us now.
1262
Charging from victory to
victory in the hearts of men.
1263
What's that?
1264
Abu Sofyan is coming!
Abu Sofyan!
1265
Why am I insulted like this?
1266
I'm Abu Sofyan!
1267
I expect some courtesy!
1268
We are not at war,
we have a truce!
1269
I have come to speak to
Muhammad, where is he?
1270
He is in the mosque.
1271
Muhammad, we did not break the truce.
1272
I have come to reaffirm the truce.
1273
I speak for Mecca.
1274
Muhammad, why do you turn from me?
1275
Don't go.
1276
Muhammad, don't go!
1277
Bedouins broke the truce, not us!
1278
The night was dark!
1279
I am here to testify,
the night was dark!
1280
Barra, Barra this is your city!
1281
Hudayfa, you are my kin,
aim to see for me!
1282
I must be heard!
1283
I am Mecca!
1284
I am the leader of Mecca!
1285
Why am I insulted like this?!
1286
Because you keep no promise
and respect no pledge.
1287
I have heard what
I never thought I'd hear:
1288
Abu Sofyan asking for pity.
1289
To be outfought, outfought,
1290
outmaneuvered by a one-time shepherd!
1291
You saw that shepherd's
religion grow from a speck.
1292
Speck was in my eye...
1293
I could see nothing.
1294
Tell Mecca their gods are dead.
1295
It is useless to resist God.
1296
Travel fast, or every man here
will be close behind you.
1297
It's you who have broken the truce.
1298
<i>For tonight will be ten thousand,
men from every tribe.</i>
1299
Now we can fight them, you are back.
1300
We will close the streets,
and defend from the houses.
1301
It's no use.
1302
There are thousands of them,
every hour they are joined by more.
1303
You coward!
1304
Hind, go home!
1305
You coward!
1306
Are you the leader of Mecca?!
1307
Look at yourself!
1308
You are broke, they swallowed
you and spat you back!
1309
Did my father and brother die,
for my husband to run away?!
1310
You go home! You!
1311
We can not resist! Mecca is taken.
1312
No, no!
1313
We are to camp here for the night.
1314
I can see Mecca, even
through the mountains.
1315
So many fires, I cannot count them.
1316
It's very beautiful.
1317
When we drove them out of Mecca,
1318
I did not know they
carried Mecca with them.
1319
We can smell the bread they're baking.
1320
Yes, it means they don't intend to plunder,
1321
at least I hope that's what it means.
1322
They don't want blood on
their own walls and doorsteps.
1323
I can bargain with that.
1324
Take me to him.
1325
So you are giving us the city?
1326
You offer me no bread.
1327
I understand.
1328
You may decide to kill me.
1329
Say what you have come to say.
1330
I saw your fires,
1331
the men around them,
1332
and I know what power
you put into your men.
1333
We can no longer resist Muhammad.
1334
Now if you'll agree.
1335
You dare to come here
and ask for conditions?
1336
Isn't it time yet for you to
recognize who Muhammad is?
1337
Muhammad, there is
still doubt in my heart.
1338
If I were to cut off your head,
it would remove all your doubts.
1339
Khalid,
1340
there's no compulsion in religion.
1341
A man may take many years
or only need minutes.
1342
It's God who decides the time.
1343
So respect his doubts.
1344
You're a black slave,
you are the best school.
1345
I am only what God has given me.
1346
Yes.
1347
The gods that I worshipped,
1348
they don't have any use.
1349
It would have helped me.
1350
I declare, under no compulsion:
1351
there is one God,
1352
and you are the messenger of God.
1353
Now, let me go.
1354
Get inside!
1355
No doors may be broken down,
nothing plundered, nothing seized!
1356
No one abused!
1357
All behind closed doors are safe!
1358
All in Abu Sofyan's house are safe!
1359
All by the Kaaba are safe!
1360
At least he kept his word,
they haven't forced a door.
1361
He's stolen hearts, not walls.
It's a permanent victory.
1362
I dread going out.
1363
We must, we must at the end.
1364
Were we so wrong?
1365
The way we lived,
yes, that was wrong.
1366
We were trapped in our own faults.
1367
Our gods were less than us.
1368
Now there he is, making
his entrance to the Kaaba.
1369
<i>In the name of God,
most gracious, most merciful.</i>
1370
<i>God gave this house to
Abraham to be a sacred place.</i>
1371
<i>Worship no other gods but Him
and cleanse his house.</i>
1372
<i>So it was.</i>
1373
<i>Muhammad took no
revenge and allowed none.</i>
1374
<i>He declared Mecca a holy place.</i>
1375
<i>No one may shed blood
or cut down a tree,</i>
1376
<i>or kill a living thing in Mecca.</i>
1377
<i>Soon, all Arabia was converted.</i>
1378
<i> Not only to the new worship</i>
1379
<i>but to the new laws, manners,
attitudes contained in Islam.</i>
1380
<i>The Prophet had lived
to see his work done,</i>
1381
<i>but now he began to
feel the nearness of death.</i>
1382
<i>One great act of his
prophethood remained,</i>
1383
<i>the setting of it's seal.</i>
1384
<i>He called the people to him</i>
1385
<i>and he spoke for the last time
His message of surrender to God</i>
1386
<i>and humanity to man.</i>
1387
''Oh, mankind! Listen well!"
1388
"I may not be with you much longer."
1389
"The weak among you,
feed them on what you eat."
1390
"Dress them as you are dressed."
1391
"You will meet your God,"
1392
"and He will call you to
account for your actions."
1393
"Let those who are present
warn those who are absent."
1394
"You are all are descendant from Adam,"
1395
"and the best among you
is he who most regards God."
1396
"Think deeply about what I say."
1397
"Let all your feuds be abolished."
1398
"You must know that every Muslim
is the brother of every other Muslim."
1399
"And all Muslims are
brothers one of another."
1400
"Between Muslims, there
are no races and no tribes."
1401
"Nor must you take
anything from your brother,"
1402
"except what is given freely."
1403
"Do not oppress
and do not be oppressed."
1404
"O my people,"
1405
"I am but a man."
1406
"It may be that the angel
of death will visit me soon,"
1407
"and death will overtake me."
1408
"But I have left you a book,"
1409
"revealed by God, the Quran,"
1410
"which is light and guidance."
1411
<i>Now he repeated to the people
the final revelation of the Quran,</i>
1412
<i>the seal and termination,</i>
1413
<i>not Muhammad's words,
but God's word:</i>
1414
''This day I have perfected
your religion for you"
1415
"and completed my favour to you"
1416
"and I've chosen for you
Islam as your religion.''
1417
<i>On June the 8th, 632,</i>
1418
<i>in his 63rd year,</i>
1419
<i>Muhammad died.</i>
1420
<i>Many of his followers
could not believe the fact.</i>
1421
<i>How can such a man die?</i>
1422
<i>But Abu Bakr, the Prophet's friend
stood up in the mosque:</i>
1423
"If anyone worships Muhammad,"
1424
"let him know that Muhammad is dead."
1425
"But he who worships God,"
1426
"let him know that God
is alive and can not die.''
1427
<i>They buried Muhammad
beside his mosque, in Medina.</i>
1428
<i>But the religion he preached
found it's place in the heart of man.</i>
1429
<i>It endured. It multiplied.</i>
1430
<i>Still to Mecca they come, mankind.</i>
1431
<i>The people of Islam
dressed in their pilgrim white.</i>
1432
<i>All equal before God,</i>
1433
<i>all united in this place of prayer.</i>
1434
<i>Each individual soul joined
in a community of worship:</i>
1435
<i>"ONE GOD"</i>
1436
<i> Synced By JiSiN</i>
